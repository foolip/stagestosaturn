<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
<p><span class="page" id="xix"> </span> Dr. Rudolph
Hermann, Director of the Research Institute of the University of
Alabama at Huntsville (UAH), encouraged much of the early work of the
Saturn history project. His successor, Dr. John F. Porter, Jr., and
Dr. J. Edwin Rush, Director of Graduate Programs and Research at UAH,
provided continuing encouragement and support.</p>
<p>Frederick I. Ordway III and David L.
Christensen were primarily responsible for acquiring specialized
documentation under the UAH contract. With unusual accuracy and
efficiency, Mrs. M. L. Childress helped set up the documentary files
and their annotated index and typed several early drafts of the
history. John Stuart Beltz, one of the original historians on the
project, drafted several “working papers” on aspects of the Saturn
program that were helpful in preparing the final manuscript. Beltz
conducted several interviews and acquired contractor documentation,
particularly concerning the S-II stage of the Saturn V. Many long
conversations with him helped shape this and other parts of the
Saturn narrative. Mitchell R. Sharpe of George C. Marshall Space
Flight Center developed working papers and bibliographies on early
rocket history and assisted in acquiring materials on Saturn
management (<a href="ch9.htm">chapter
9</a>) and the “all-up” launch of the
first Saturn V (<a href="ch12.htm">chapter
12</a>).</p>
<p>At the MSFC Historical Office, David S. Akens,
Leo L. Jones, and A. Ruth Jarrell offered continuous assistance.
After the office was abolished, Robert G. Sheppard, Don Lakey, and
Betty Davis helped fill requests for additional information and
coordinated the distribution of preliminary copies of the manuscript
within MSFC for editorial comment. Bonnie Holmes, in the MSFC
Director’s Office, provided invaluable help during a follow-up
research visit to MSFC during the summer of 1975 and helped acquire
photographs and drawings.</p>
<p>During the final phases of completing the
manuscript, the documents of the Saturn history project were
temporarily transferred to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) near the
University of Houston/Clear Lake City (UH/CLC) campus. James M.
Grimwood, JSC Historian, not only <span class="page" id="xx"> </span> provided shelf space
for these documents but also provided office facilities, access to
the coffee pot, encouragement, and advice. My debt to him is
considerable. I wish to thank Sally Gates and my other colleagues,
also of JSC, at work on NASA histories: Edward and Linda Ezell and
David Compton, whose interest and suggestions were unfailingly
helpful. At UH/CLC, Dr. Calvin Cannon, Dean of Human Sciences and
Humanities, and Dr. Peter Fischer, Director of Programs in
Humanities, generously cooperated in arranging teaching duties to
benefit research and writing. Special thanks go to Jean Sherwood and
Myra Hewitt Young who worked so cheerfully and conscientiously in
typing the manuscript.</p>
<p>Dr. Eugene M. Emme, of the History Office at
NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., organized and guided the NASA
historical program and monitored the Apollo-Saturn history effort.
Lee Saegesser, archivist in the History Office, invariably turned up
needed illustrations and documents. I owe a special debt, however, to
Dr. Monte D. Wright, Director of the History Office, and Dr. Frank
W. Anderson, Jr., Publications Manager, for their painstaking and
thorough editing of early drafts of the manuscript. I learned much
from their criticisms, and the manuscript, I trust, is much the
better for their close attention to it. I would like to emphasize
here that I have had complete freedom in interpreting the Saturn
program in my own way. I was only cautioned at one point
<i>not</i> to
write in such a way to open myself to the charge of delivering a
“company history.”</p>
<p>Personnel from NASA and contractors’ offices
all over the United States diligently and graciously responded to
requests for additional illustrations and documentation. Dozens of
NASA and contractor personnel (the majority of whom still remain
unknown to me) read various drafts of the manuscript and returned
copies with suggestions and corrections. Since I cannot possibly
identify and list all of them, I can only acknowledge my great
obligation to their interest in this history of Saturn. Likewise, I
want to acknowledge the cooperation extended by the dozens of NASA
and contractor personnel who consented to interviews. As for any
remaining errors of fact or interpretation, they are mine.

and I wish to acknowledge the following publications and editors for
cooperation in incorporating revised versions in the present text:

<p>I could never have finished the history of
Saturn without the affection and encouragement of my wife Linda and
without the heart-warming interest of Paula and Alex in “the rocket
book.”</p>
