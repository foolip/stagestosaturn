<h1>VII. Epilogue</h1>
<p><span class="page" id="p379"> </span> Both the Soviets
and the Americans used their man-rated space rockets for a variety of
missions. NASA used basic Saturn hardware for launching the Skylab
space station; Skylab itself evolved from the Saturn V third stage.
The last Saturn rocket to be launched culminated in the linkup of a
manned American spacecraft with its manned Soviet counterpart—the
Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.</p>
<p>Thus, one of the legacies of what started as a
race in space ended in a new arena of international cooperation. The
Saturn program left other legacies. The city of Huntsville, Alabama,
entered a new era of social and economic vigor, since Marshall Space
Flight Center’s activities attracted nonspace commercial enterprises
to a booming locale and injected vitality into health care,
education, municipal services, and the arts. Finally, execution of
the Saturn program stimulated significant research and improved
technique across a wide range of fabrication and manufacturing
processes.</p>

<h2>13. Legacies</h2>
<p><span class="page" id="p381"> </span> The Apollo-Saturn
program began in an atmosphere of international competition, the
object of which was to beat the Russians to a manned landing on the
moon. In terms of heavy payloads and successful manned flights,
Soviet boosters and aeronautical sophistication seemed to set the
pace for the exploration of space for several years after Sputnik.
The Gemini program of the mid-1960s considerably enhanced American
skills in manned space flight, and development of the Saturn I,
Saturn IB, and Saturn V gave the United States a booster capability
that surpassed the Soviet boosters. With the three-man Apollo
spacecraft, the Apollo-Saturn combination carried not one, but seven
manned missions to the lunar surface. In big boosters, where the
United States had always lagged, Saturn finally retired the
cup.</p>
<p>The Soviet space program conducted an
impressive series of unmanned research missions, including remote
reconnaissance and sampling of the lunar surface by robots, and the
return of small samples to Earth. Yet the Russians had not landed a
cosmonaut on the moon by the mid-1970s despite some spectacular
manned missions, involving orbital rendezvous, docking, and crew
transfer, using Soyuz spacecraft. Although the Russians successfully
orbited their Salyut space station in combination with manned Soyuz
launches in 1971, <i>Soyuz 10</i> did not complete the transfer of the three
cosmonauts and the crew of <i>Soyuz 11</i> died during reentry.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the American space program
was also moving ahead with a variety of unmanned satellites and
probes, and the momentum of Saturn resulted in a genuine space
station, the Skylab. The last launch of a Saturn vehicle was a
singular event, achieving orbital <span class="page" id="p382"> </span> linkup of manned
spacecraft—one from the U.S. and the other from the U.S.S.R.
</p>
<h3>Saturn, Skylab, and Apollo-Soyuz</h3>
<p>Skylab was the final version of several plans
to modify the Saturn S-IVB stage so that it could be occupied by
astronauts in space. The Skylab assembly consisted of several
modules, including the orbital workshop (a modified S-IVB stage),
airlock module, multiple docking adapter, and Apollo telescope mount.
This modular payload was launched to low Earth orbit aboard a
two-stage Saturn V, with the Skylab in the upper position normally
occupied by the S-IVB third stage.</p>
<p>The idea of using a Saturn stage as a space
station apparently developed while planning Saturn I and Saturn IB
mission profiles. In the normal sequence of events, S-IV and S-IVB
upper stages of these vehicles became space-age “orphans.” Their
propellants expended, the empty stages remained uselessly in orbit.
With such large tanks circling the Earth, it was not long before some
thoughtful engineers wondered why it would not be possible to use an
empty stage as a habitat for astronauts. In November 1962, Douglas
Aircraft, the S-IVB contractor, published a short study suggesting
the use of the S-IVB as a laboratory in space. A group of engineers
at MSFC evidently had a parallel concept in mind, although they had
not yet committed anything to paper.</p>
<p>During the next few years, the increasing
tempo of the Apollo-Saturn program absorbed the thoughts and energies
of planners at both Douglas and Marshall Space Flight Center, and
nothing was accomplished in terms of turning a spent stage into a
space laboratory. Early in 1965, however, program analysts at MSFC
who were thinking ahead began to use the terms “spent stage” and “wet
workshop” in talking about refurbishing the S-IVB in orbit and using
it as a laboratory. The idea lacked programmatic approval or support
until early August, when George Mueller announced the organization
within Headquarters of an Apollo Applications Program Office to
extend use of the hardware developed for Apollo-Saturn. Late in
August, as part of Marshall’s contributions to the Apollo
Applications Program (AAP), a full-fledged design study was initiated
to examine the concept of the spent stage laboratory and to come to
some conclusions about its potential. On 1 December 1965, George
Mueller gave the go-ahead for what was now called the orbital
workshop, with MSFC as the lead center in the project.</p>
<p>The overall AAP, including the orbital
workshop concept, originally contemplated a large number of both
Saturn IB and Saturn V vehicles. In 1966, one early planning schedule
called for 26 IB launches (primarily to carry three-man crews), and
19 Saturn V launches. Three S-IVB spent stages, three Saturn V
workshops, and four Apollo telescope mounts
<span class="page" id="p383"> </span> were to be orbited. Included in this ambitious
schedule were five more lunar missions and two synchronous-orbit
missions. The S-IVB spent stage would be converted to a lab by use of
the spent-stage experiment support modules. Mounted on the forward
end of the S-IVB, this module was a docking facility and airlock for
the Apollo command and service modules. Because the S-IVB lacked crew
quarters, the crew would live and conduct biomedical experiments in
the command module, while the empty S-IVB would provide a suitable
environment for familiarization with zero-g conditions in a
comparatively large enclosed environment in
space.<a href="notes.htm#n13.1">[1]</a></p>
<p>By December 1966, plans called for a “wet”
workshop, created by purging and then pressurizing the hydrogen tank
in orbit to create a working environment inside. A significant
addition to the scheme was an Apollo telescope mount, to be carried
into orbit by another Saturn IB and connected to the orbiting
workshop. Between 1967 and 1969, the plans for the workshop concept
shifted with budgetary constraints and available hardware. Finally,
in July 1969, Administrator Paine announced that the “wet” workshop
was being dropped in favor of a “dry” workshop. Under this new
approach, the workshop and the Apollo telescope mount were to be
launched together by using the first two stages of the Saturn V
(instead of an uprated Saturn I). All equipment, expendables, and
experiments would be installed ahead of time in the workshop, ready
for use when the astronaut crews made their rendezvous and docked. In
August 1969, McDonnell Douglas became the contractor for two Saturn V
workshops. The first workshop was scheduled for launch into a low
Earth orbit sometime in 1972, with the second version serving as a
backup.<a href="notes.htm#n13.2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Early in 1970, NASA Headquarters announced
that the AAP would henceforth be called the Skylab Program. In
addition MSFC announced that the Saturn IB, carrying the three Skylab
astronauts, would be launched from the modified Launch Complex 39B at
Cape Kennedy. The Skylab Program at this time called for launch of
the Skylab from LC 39A, followed the next day by a Saturn IB launch
carrying the astronauts. The first crew was programmed to spend 28
days in orbit, and within the next six months, two more manned
missions would put three-man crews into the Skylab for approximately
56 days apiece. Following these missions, Skylab would then be put
into a storage mode, remaining in orbit.<a href="notes.htm#n13.3">[3]</a> </p>
<p>Developmental and technical problems created a
delay in the anticipated launch date, which was finally rescheduled
for the spring of 1973. Meanwhile the Saturn IB first stage for the
first manned Skylab launch vehicle was taken out of an
environmentally controlled enclosure at the Michoud Assembly
Facility, where the stage had been in hibernation for three years.
This particular booster was one of nine such Saturn IB stages stored
at Michoud in December 1968. Altogether, four Saturn IB stages were
designated for the Skylab project: AS-206, AS-207, AS-208, and
<span class="page" id="p384"> </span> AS-209. Refurbishment of each vehicle was estimated
at approximately 10 months. The AS-209 vehicle served as the backup
stage, in case a possible rescue mission needed to be dispatched to
the Skylab in orbit, using a modified CSM to return five
astronauts.<a href="notes.htm#n13.4">[4]</a></p>
<p>On 14 May 1973, the Skylab went into orbit
aboard the AS-513 booster. Skylab was a fairly roomy space station,
about as large as a medium-sized two-bedroom house, and provided a
true “shirt-sleeve” environment for the astronaut crew, permitting
them to live and work inside the Skylab without cumbersome space
suits. NASA technicians soon realized, however, that something had
gone very wrong. During the launch, a protective micrometeoroid and
heat shield was torn loose, and one of the two solar power arrays, to
provide electrical power to the Skylab, was also ripped away. The
remaining solar wing was only partly deployed, and lack of power
allowed the temperatures inside the Skylab to soar. A crash program
by NASA and contractor technicians came up with a possible solution
in the form of a large parasol device to deflect the sun’s rays and
reduce interior heat. With special equipment to set up the parasol
and cut away the debris to free the solar wing, the first Skylab crew
took off much later than originally planned, on 25 May 1973.
</p>
<p>After docking, deployment of the sunshade cut
the high temperatures inside Skylab, allowing the crew to move in.
Still, because of the jammed solar panel, problems of temperature
control and inadequate power persisted. Working outside the Skylab
and using the tools brought along for this specific task, astronauts
Charles Conrad, Jr., and Joseph Kerwin finally freed the power panel.
The makeshift shade, plus partially restored power, reduced interior
temperatures to comfortable levels, and the mission proceeded. The
three-man crew spent a month in space, after adjusting to early
discomfort from extended weightlessness. On their return, physicians
endorsed ambitious plans for the two succeeding crews to stay up from
two to three months. The second Skylab crew, launched on 18 July
1973, spent 59 days in orbit; the third crew, launched 16 November
1973, spent a record-breaking 84 consecutive days in space before
splashdown on 8 February 1974. One of the major contributions of the
Skylab program was convincing proof that crews could indeed spend
extended period in weightlessness, perform effectively, and suffer no
harmful effects on return.</p>
<p>In addition to these invaluable biomedical
records and results, the Skylab crews conducted a wide variety of
sophisticated experiments on the characteristics of the Earth’s
environment and resources, collected data on the sun and the solar
system, and experimented with possible types of esoteric industrial
processes that could be enhanced by performing them in the
environment of space, avoiding the perturbing factors of the Earth’s
rotation and effect of gravity. Some of the more significant
astronautical work during the Skylab missions involved extended
observations of an unusual period of solar flare activity in 1973.
Late in the
<span class="page" id="p385"> </span> year, the astronauts took advantage of a
target of opportunity and studied the newly discovered comet Kohoutek
from their unparalleled point of view in space. In total, the Skylab
missions accumulated extensive new knowledge of the oceans, weather
formation and climate, pollution, and natural
resources.<a href="notes.htm#n13.5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Left, a Saturn IB lifts from Launch Complex 39 to
send <i>Skylab 4</i> on the final orbital mission with the Skylab
orbital workshop (right), which had been previously orbited on the
last Saturn V flight. The three Saturn IB launches in Skylab employed
the foreshortening tower (seen here) as a base so that they could use
the Saturn V umbilical tower.</p>
</div>
<p>The last Saturn vehicle to be launched was
AS-210, on 15 July 1975. Although the Saturns were originally
developed in response to what was seen as intense Soviet competition
for domination in space, the last flight of a Saturn launch vehicle
featured a cooperative mission with the Soviets in space. This was
the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). The mission involved the
joining, in Earth orbit, of spacecraft of the United States and the
Soviet Union. Following many months of preliminary talks and
agreements, in May 1972 the Russians and Americans agreed to work out
a common docking system for future generations of spacecraft, leading
to the ASTP mission. The mission marked the first time that manned
spacecraft of different nations met in space for cooperative
engineering and scientific activities.</p>
<p>The ASTP launch vehicle’s first stage had been
built by the Chrysler Corporation at Michoud Assembly Facility in
January 1967. Following static-firing tests in the spring of 1967,
the stage was put in storage at Michoud, where it remained until
October 1972. After the first stage was
<span class="page" id="p386"> </span> modified, refurbished, and checked out, it was
shipped to KSC in April 1974. After more months of storage, the first
and second stages were stacked, and the vehicle was placed on the
mobile launcher in January 1975. The S-IVB second stage was of the
same vintage, completed in 1967 by McDonnell Douglas at Huntington
Beach, California, and was stored there until the fall of 1972, when
it was shipped to the Kennedy Space Center. The instrument unit,
built by IBM, shared a similar manufacturing and storage history. It
was shipped to KSC by barge in May 1974. After stacking, the entire
vehicle was rolled out to the launch pad late in March 1975;
continuous preflight checkouts and monitoring of the launch vehicle
were made until launch that summer.<a href="notes.htm#n13.6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The Russians were also preparing their launch
vehicle and spacecraft. Considerable exchange of technical
information was required between Soviet and American mission
personnel. Most of these contacts concerned spacecraft, docking,
telemetry, and crewmen. Even with the insights gained into Russian
astronautical technology acquired as a result of the ASTP
collaboration, public knowledge of Soviet launch vehicles is still
sketchy in many details. As far as the engines are concerned, the
Russians apparently based their propulsion systems on technology
garnered from the V-2s wrested from Germany after World War II. Like
the Americans, Russian technicians got their early experience in
launching captured German weapons and then produced a series of
modified V-2s as they began to develop their own ballistic missile
technology. Early in the 1950s, the Russians evidently began work on
a very large propulsion system planned for their first ICBM and
considered using this propulsion system in space programs as
well.</p>
<p>Although extrapolated from V-2 engine
technology, this new Soviet engine incorporated a somewhat novel
arrangement, featuring multiple combustion chambers. The physical
appearance of the engine, with its quartet of combustion chambers,
normally creates some confusion in the mind of an observer who
associates American-style engines with a single turbopump, combustion
chamber, and exhaust nozzle. In the Russian version, a single
turbopump fed the oxidizer and fuel to a combination of combustion
chambers. Thus, while appearing to be a cluster of engines, it is
actually a cluster of four combustion chambers and exhaust nozzles.
The Russians designated this propulsion system the RD-107. The RD-107
burned kerosene-type fuel and liquid oxygen, and the cluster of four
combustion chambers and exit nozzles produced a total thrust of 1 000
400 newtons (224 910 pounds). The turbopump was fueled by hydrogen
peroxide. This engine system did not have a gimbaling capacity, but
included two small steering rockets. The Soviets produced a variant
of this engine system known as the RD-108, which differed from its
cousin only in the fact that it had four small steering rockets
instead of two.</p>
<p>The combination of these engine systems as a
single booster powered the series of large Soviet launch vehicles,
including the Sputnik, and <span class="page" id="p387"> </span> with further
variations in the upper stages, the Vostok, the Soyuz, and the Salyut
space station. The basic launch vehicle was known in the United
States as the type “A” booster, and it was also used by the Russians
for some unmanned payloads.</p>
<p>The booster design situated the RD-108 as the
central core engine, also acting as a sustainer engine. Then four
RD-107 engines, with long streamlined fairings, were clustered about
this central core. Integration of the parts of the launch vehicle and
attaching the payload took place in the horizontal position. Still
horizontal, the entire vehicle was rolled out on a conveyor that
resembled a railroad flatcar and positioned in the upright launch
position at the launch pad. The Sputnik booster was a single-stage
vehicle, although the Vostok, Soyuz, and Salyut vehicles incorporated
upper stages that apparently used similar liquid oxygen and kerosene
propellants. In the launch sequence, all the first-stage engines were
ignited on the pad. The ignition meant a striking liftoff, with 20
main engine nozzles spouting flame, accompanied by the exhaust plumes
of the 12 steering rockets. All 20 main engines continued to function
during the boost phase. As propellants were depleted in the four
outboard RD-107 engines, these fell away, leaving the RD-108 (the
central sustainer unit), which continued to fire. Depending upon the
nature of the mission programmed for the upper stages, the central
core then separated from the upper-stage combination late in the
boost phase, and a combination of upper stages put the payload into
orbit or a space trajectory. The Russian launch vehicle, with its
four elongated RD-107 streamlined units, looked rather graceful, more
like a Buck-Rogers-type rocket than some of the American
boosters.<a href="notes.htm#n13.7">[7]</a></p>
<p>In retrospect, these Russian launch vehicles
of the A series appear to be somewhat less sophisticated than their
American counterparts, but no less effective in getting heavy
payloads into orbit. As ex-Soviet engineer and editor Leonid
Vladimirov pointed out, the RD-107 system took up more space than a
comparable single-chamber engine of the same power. This meant that
the diameter of the first stage of the launch vehicle was also
larger, resulting in a considerably greater launch weight. For this
reason, the jettison of the four outboard engine systems, leaving the
sustainer to carry the vehicle into orbit, was an important design
feature of the Russian launch vehicles. “It was, of course, a very
complicated, costly and clumsy solution of the problem,” Vladimirov
admitted. “But it was a solution nonetheless; all launchings of
Soviet manned spacecraft and all the space-shots to Venus and Mars
have been carried out with the aid of this monstrous twenty-engined
cluster.”</p>
<p>There were other interesting variations in
U.S. and Soviet booster technology. The tank skins and structural
elements of American vehicles were kept at minimum thicknesses, shaving
the weight of the structure as much as possible to enhance the
payload capability. The first Western insight into the style of
Soviet vehicle structure occurred in 1967, when
<span class="page" id="p388"> </span> the Vostok spacecraft and booster system were put on
display in Paris. The Russians series of A-type vehicles appear to
have been exceedingly heavy. The Vostok launch vehicle arrived via
Rouen, France, by sea, prior to shipment to Paris. To move the tank
sections of the launch vehicle, workers hooked up cables to the
opposite ends of the tank sections and picked them up empty,
surprising many Western onlookers who expected them to buckle in the
middle. Their amazement was compounded when the Soviet technicians
proceeded to walk the length of these tank sections, still suspended
in mid-air, without damaging them in the least. The Russian vehicles
were, if anything, extremely rugged. The launching weight of the
Vostok and spacecraft is still a matter of conjecture because the
Soviets have not released specific numbers. Vladimirov estimated
around 400 metric tons on the ground, with the greater part of the
weight accounted for by the heavy engines. He drew an interesting
comparison between the Soviet type A vehicle and the American launch
vehicle known as the Titan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The Russian vehicle] had a total thrust
from the engines of its first stage of 500 tons which put into
orbit a load weighing only 40–45% more than the weight of <i>Gemini</i>.
You simply have to compare the <i>Titan</i>’s 195-ton thrust for a three
and a half ton useful load with the Soviets rockets 500-ton thrust
lifting a five ton load.<a href="notes.htm#n13.8">[8]</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the Russians never really developed a
launch vehicle with the capability of the Saturn V, they apparently
attempted to do so. Rumors of this new vehicle, known as type G,
gained currency following a space conference in Spain in 1966. Rather
than develop new, exotic high-energy propellants and propulsion
systems, Soviet designers reportedly used engines from advanced ICBMs
and clustered a large number of chambers to achieve high thrust. The
type G booster was rolled out during the summer of 1969, but during a
static test, a leak evidently began in one of the upper stages,
developed into a fire, and destroyed the entire vehicle. The
disastrous fire also wiped out the launch facility, including
underground equipment complexes as well as service towers and other
support equipment at the launch site. Reports indicate that a type G
vehicle was launched in midsummer of 1971, but the rocket broke up
and disintegrated before reaching orbit. In November 1972, the
Russians made one more attempt to launch the big type G rocket. Bad
luck continued to plague the effort, and the 1972 mission also ended
in disaster, apparently because of a failure in the first stage. As
1975 came to a close, development of the type G seemed to be in a
state of limbo.<a href="notes.htm#n13.9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Thus, the Soyuz spacecraft for ASTP relied on
the time-tested type A booster. According to plan, the Russians
launched first, early in the morning of 15 July, when cosmonauts
Aleksey Leonov and Valery Kubasov lifted off from the Soviet
Cosmodrome at Baykonur in Central Asia. Seven and a half hours later,
the Saturn IB lifted off from Cape <span class="page" id="p389"> </span> Kennedy, Florida,
carrying American astronauts Thomas P. Stafford, Vance Brand, and
Donald K. Slayton.</p>
<p>The ASTP mission was a perfect finale for the
Saturn program. The countdown for the launch vehicle and performance
during the boost phase proceeded without a hitch. MSFC press releases
noted that the Saturn IB carried the oldest engine yet flown, a
nine-year-old veteran.<a href="notes.htm#n13.10">[10]</a> After ASTP, the inventory of Saturns in storage
consisted of two Saturn IB vehicles, SA-209 (backup for both the
Skylab and the ASTP missions) and SA-211, and two unassigned Saturn V
vehicles, SA-514 and SA-515.</p>
<p><span class="page" id="p390"> </span> Behind these
retired symbols of space exploration, the proficiency of MSFC
persisted. With its competence in propulsion systems, Marshall was
given responsibility for development and management of engines for
the shuttle program, conducted R&amp;D programs in space tracking and
communications, and studied various space payloads for the future. In
short, MSFC carried on a continuing influence in Huntsville and
northern Alabama and in the nation’s space program.</p>

<h3>Astronautics in Huntsville</h3>
<p>The elaboration of the nation’s space program
in the 1960s and early 1970s had an obvious impact in the south and
southeast, anchored by major NASA centers. NASA’s geographic
influence in the region stretched along a great arc, from the Manned
Spacecraft Center in Texas, to Marshall Space Flight Center in
Alabama, to Kennedy Space Center in Florida. In between were MSFC’s
“satellites” near New Orleans: the Michoud Assembly Facility, the
Slidell computer complex, and the Mississippi Test Facility. This
concentration of space-related expertise and activities has been
described as “a fertile crescent” of astronautical skills.
Development of these centers of major NASA activities created
extensive local and regional changes, and the story of the impact of
NASA in Huntsville is paralleled in many respects by the events that
occurred south of Houston and near the Kennedy Space
Center.<a href="notes.htm#n13.11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Before the von Braun team came to Huntsville,
Alabama, the town was known as “Water Cress Capital of the World.”
Its population was 16 000. Even so, this period of Huntsville’s
“salad days” continued strong ties with the cotton textile industry,
and Huntsville once boasted 13 cotton mills in the area. Throughout
the 1940s, the other major source of employment in the area had been
the Redstone Arsenal. Established in 1941, the 1620-square-kilometer
arsenal was used by the U.S. Army in the production and testing of
chemical warfare weapons. After the war, it was shut down, declared
surplus property, and put up for sale in 1949. Huntsville city
fathers and local politicians, including Senator John Sparkman and
Representative Bob Jones, were soon sounding out their contacts in
the Department of Defense to see what could be done to keep the
Arsenal alive. Jones and Sparkman were hot on the trail of a new
location for wind tunnel test facilities for the Air Force, but lost
out to the state of Tennessee. The wind tunnel was located at the
recently closed Camp Forest at Tullahoma, and was eventually named
the Arnold Engineering Development Center. Nevertheless, Sparkman and
Jones had made an impression. Secretary of the Air Force Stuart
Symington told Sparkman that Alabama would get something better in
the long run. A few weeks later, the Alabama congressmen found out
exactly what they <span class="page" id="p391"> </span> were acquiring—the
Army’s Rocket Research and Development Suboffice, to be relocated
from Fort Bliss, Texas.<a href="notes.htm#n13.12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Huntsville had been one of the several sites
under consideration. The site selection committee included von Braun,
and he was enthusiastic about Huntsville from the beginning. “For me,
it was love at first sight,” he said. Among other things, the
advantages of Huntsville included the existing Arsenal facilities,
abundant low-cost electric power from the TVA, the Tennessee River
(both for water supply and transportation), and the open space. “In
selecting this site, of course,” von Braun recalled, “in our field we
had to consider that these rockets would be making a lot of
noise.”<a href="notes.htm#n13.13">[13]</a> After the arrival of the Army’s missile agency in
April 1950, Huntsville started its meteoric growth, from 16 000 in
1950 to 48 000 enumerated in a special census held in 1956. The 1960
census put the population of the city at 72 000; another special
census in 1964 gave the population as 123 000; in 1970 it was 136
102. Construction boomed during the first half of the 1960s: the city
of Huntsville was 195th in population in the United States, but
ranked 25th in building construction.</p>
<p>In 1950, the city limits extended about one
and a half kilometers from each side of the courthouse, encompassing
11.1 square kilometers, with roughly 125 kilometers of sewer lines
but no sewage treatment plant at all. Huntsville’s effluent was piped
to a creek outside the city limits, where it was carried directly
into the Tennessee River. Tax considerations and other agreements
made earlier with the textile mills provided a stumbling block to
city plans for enlarging the city limits, along with improving sewage
facilities—which the Army was now insisting on. After numerous
sessions lasting into the early hours of the morning, representatives
from the city, the Army, and the mills came to an agreement, and in
1956 the city of Huntsville suddenly enlarged itself to over 181
square kilometers. Eventually, over 1300 kilometers of sanitary lines
and a first-rate sanitation system served the
area.<a href="notes.htm#n13.14">[14]</a></p>
<p>The influx of Army personnel, NASA civil
servants, and contractors, with their families, raised enrollments in
the city schools from 3000 in 1950 to over 33 000 by 1974. The
numbers barely suggest the problems involved in establishing
classrooms, finding teachers, and creating appropriate curricula.
Fortunately, among the families of the scientists, engineers, and
technicians pouring into the city were spouses with teaching
backgrounds to help staff the expanding school system. The schools
developed a definite scientific-technological bent, probably
encouraged by the frequent appearance of many of Marshall’s top
personnel as guests and speakers in school classrooms and assemblies.
Huntsville’s new population also gave the public schools a strong
orientation to higher education, with 80–95 percent of Huntsville’s
high school students going on to college, in comparison to a state
average of only 20 <span class="page" id="p392"> </span> percent. Rapid
population growth also brought new challenges to Huntsville’s medical
facilities. The Huntsville Hospital had been built in the 1920s. By
the early 1950s, patients were being placed in the hallways of the
hospital, and an emergency expansion finally brought the hospital’s
capacity to 150 beds. Severe pressures for medical services
persisted, and by 1970, Huntsville had four hospitals in operation
with a total of almost 1000 beds.<a href="notes.htm#n13.15">[15]</a></p>
<p>There was a parallel impact on higher
education in the city. Since 1949, the Chamber of Commerce had been
advocating a branch of the University of Alabama in Huntsville. A
center was authorized, and 139 part-time students began classes in
January 1950. The arrival of von Braun and the elaboration of Army
research immediately stimulated a graduate program. In 1960,
construction of a permanent campus began at the northern edge of the
city, and von Braun appeared before the Alabama legislature in
support of an appeal for a $3-million bond issue to establish a
research institute geared to graduate research at the new campus. The
bond request was passed easily by the legislature and approved
quickly by the voters, a success marking a sustained period of growth
by the University of Alabama in Huntsville, with a student body of
over 4000 and a replacement value of about $30 million by
1974.<a href="notes.htm#n13.16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The citizens of Huntsville always maintained a
strong interest in cultural activities, with literary and music
societies dating back several generations. The arrival of the
culturally minded German rocketeers enhanced this tradition and left
an imprint on the history of the arts in Huntsville. According to
local legend, the Germans arriving in Huntsville equipped themselves
with library cards even before the water in their homes had been
turned on. The newcomers from Fort Bliss not only appeared in public
school classrooms, giving informal lectures and talks, but were
regular attendees at local PTA meetings. Acculturation was remarkably
rapid. Three years after arriving in Huntsville, the DAR medal for
the best American history student in the city went to a young German
girl.</p>
<p>Wanting to avoid a German enclave in the
middle of the city, von Braun encouraged his associates to settle all
over Huntsville. The rocket engineers and the Huntsville natives soon
established strong bonds of common interests and activities. A local
chamber music group learned of the musical inclinations of many of
the newcomers. The day he arrived, Werner Kuers, an accomplished
violinist, was startled to receive a call to join one of the local
music groups in need of a new violin. “I was very astonished,” Kuers
recalled. “Mr. Dreger soon started to arrange playing sessions for us
in homes and churches. We were introduced into quite a number of very
friendly families interested in cultural activities and education. I
experienced a welcome in this city that I had never experienced
before anywhere.”</p>
<p><span class="page" id="p393"> </span> Thus, veterans of
Peenemuende and of Fort Bliss were quickly absorbed into the life of
Huntsville and into American culture. In April 1955, only five years
after they had arrived in Alabama, the first group of 109 Germans
became American citizens. Their naturalization took place at a public
ceremony in the Huntsville High School auditorium, part of the
officially proclaimed events of a “New Citizens’ Day” declared by the
city. Many of the newly naturalized American citizens had already
taken an active role in civic affairs. A sergeant in the Luftwaffe
when he was assigned to Peenemuende, Walter Wiesman joined the Junior
Chamber of Commerce in Huntsville soon after the von Braun team’s
arrival in 1950. Two years later—before Wiesman became a naturalized
citizen—the JCs elected him their president.<a href="notes.htm#n13.17">[17]</a></p>
<p>In Marshall Space Flight Center’s heyday, wags
sometimes referred to Huntsville as “Peenemuende South.” For years,
the city proudly called itself Rocket City, U.S.A. Nevertheless, the
city fathers, as well as von Braun himself, realized that federal
budgets, like NASA’s, had valleys as well as crests. It was widely
agreed that Huntsville should expend considerable time and energy
attracting other industries into the area. In later years, von Braun
took a considerable measure of satisfaction in remembering his role
as an advocate of diversification. “I can say in retrospect that I
have never regretted using my powers of persuasion…in talks with
the city fathers and our community advisory committee, when I always
reminded people: ‘Don’t get too used to this NASA money that’s
flowing into this area.’” He warned against becoming a
single-business town and advocated the attraction of other industries
during a period of good stability, with attention to nonaerospace
companies in particular.</p>
<p>The development of the industrial character of
Huntsville frequently reflected the high-level technology represented
by NASA and the U.S. Army Missile Command, on the site of the old
Redstone Arsenal. The continuing development of the Cummings Research
Park characterized this high-level technology. Located near the
University of Alabama campus, the Research Park comprised over 30
companies that offered unique management services and research
facilities and employed over 6000 people with an annual payroll of
over $93 million by 1974. In the 1960s, the emphasis was on space,
but the farsightedness of von Braun and other Huntsville industrial
executives maintained a healthy diversity in the city’s manufacturing
companies in the 1970s. At the Research Park and elsewhere, including
an industrial center located near the new Jetport, Huntsville’s
products included automobile radios, digital clocks, electronic
parts, computers, TV cameras, ax handles, flags, aircraft specialty
glass, tools and dies, telephones, rubber tires, and a host of other
goods and services.<a href="notes.htm#n13.18">[18]</a></p>
<p>One of the most visible results of the von
Braun team’s sojourn in Huntsville was the new Von Braun Civic Center
located downtown near a <span class="page" id="p394"> </span> renewal area known
as Big Spring Park. A $14-million complex that opened in 1975, the
center included a large arena, as well as a spacious exhibit hall. A
concert hall and playhouse provided exceptionally fine facilities for
both performers and audience. Finally, the performing arts in
Huntsville were no longer dependent upon the good will of various
churches and high school auditoriums. The homeless graphic arts of
the city at last found, in the Von Braun Center, a handsome new
creative arts museum, with arrangements for both permanent and
visiting art exhibits. The city also acquired a major tourist
attraction, the Alabama Space and Rocket Center. The Center not only
coordinated tours at MSFC, but also mounted some innovative displays.
Skillfully planned and automated dioramas and indoor exhibits
explained the theory of the solar system, fundamentals of rocket
propulsion, future space exploration, and numerous other aspects of
astronautics. The indoor displays also featured an eye-catching array
of aerospace hardware, including full-sized mockups of spacecraft and
genuine artifacts such as Saturn engines. The most impressive section
was outdoors, where a rocket display area included several Army
missiles, a V-2, and several early NASA launch vehicles. Towering
above them all, a Saturn I stood erect, and a complete Saturn V
rocket, stretched out on its side, loomed as a
backdrop.<a href="notes.htm#n13.19">[19]</a></p>

<h3>The Significance of Saturn</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 1em 0"><i>Spinoff</i></p>
<p>The impact of the Saturn program in Huntsville
was to be expected, but there were also much broader influences. Many
Americans believed that the national space program would be the
source of significant products for use in everyday life. Although
many products found their way into ordinary life as a result of space
research, the expectations for immediate impact were probably too
optimistic. In his thoughtful and provocative book, <i>Second Order
Consequences</i>, Raymond Bauer noted that the design and development of
space hardware, systems, and subsystems were specialized from the
beginning. It has not always been easy, therefore, to transfer
technology into the market place.<a href="notes.htm#n13.20">[20]</a> </p>
<p>This is certainly not to say that space
technology has had no impact on American lives. In a larger sense,
the operation of communications satellites, weather satellites, and
environmental and resources satellites are only some examples.
Biomedical research, including techniques for monitoring and
analyzing an astronaut’s life signs during a mission, has had a
significant effect on medicine and hospital care. It has been
frequently noted that the space program in general has had a
tremendous influence on the electronics and computer industries in
stimulating
<span class="page" id="p395"> </span> considerable research and providing job
opportunities for thousands of workers and
technicians.<a href="notes.htm#n13.21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the technology represented by the
electronics and computer industries has benefited from the space
program essentially in terms of second order consequences. Much of
that technology and many of the techniques were developed for highly
sophisticated and complex space programs, and only with some changing
and adaptation were the technology and techniques found to be
suitable for other civilian applications. This factor is an example
of what Bauer and others have called the “intangible spinoff.”
Further, advances in this respect are important to
<span class="page" id="p396"> </span> technology for a couple of reasons. Taken
individually, these incremental improvements contribute to overall
efficiency and often to higher quality in day-to-day industrial
operations in the production of goods and services. As Bauer
emphasized, “Although the gain from application of a new welding
technique may be small, the aggregate benefits of many such advances,
applied in many industries and firms, can be quite large.” In
addition, Bauer emphasized it was possible for new methods, new
advances, and new ideas to come together in some combination that
would also result in a striking or significant new advance. “The
convergence of a number of such improvements, along with technical
advances arising in other fields, may make possible new fundamental
inventions of substantial individual
significance.”<a href="notes.htm#n13.22">[22]</a></p>
<p>In the development of the Saturn vehicle, many
spinoffs consisted of myriad improvements in the prosaic areas of
shop work, although such improvements were usually the result of new
fabrication technologies and use of advanced materials. William R.
Lucas, a senior engineer at MSFC and later Director of the Marshall
Space Flight Center, emphasized that the almost immediate usage of
new aluminum alloys at MSFC undoubtedly encouraged further research
and development in the field, including the development of additional
alloys, thermal treatment, and fabrication processes. By the same
token, new research and development work in the welding of aluminum
alloys also took place.<a href="notes.htm#n13.23">[23]</a> Consistent with Bauer’s comments about the
significance of the accretion of technological expertise as well as
the potential impact of convergence, one welding engineer at Marshall
Space Flight Center posed this rhetorical question: “What has the
space program contributed to welding technology?” The engineer
admitted that the question was at once blunt as well as
disconcerting—disconcerting, “because many of the contributions are
quite subtle, beyond the reach of symbolism, and often never
recognized.”<a href="notes.htm#n13.24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Marshall’s successful approach to welding
problems was not so much a function of breathtaking or striking
breakthroughs as it was a process of accretion and convergence: the
application of improved techniques, thoughtful readjustment and
realignment of certain modes of the operation as well as the
equipment, taking a slightly different approach in the operational
techniques for welding different alloys, and an increasing concern
for absolute cleanliness. At Marshall Space Flight Center, a familiar
statement was that “the weld may be defined as a continuous defect
surrounded by parent metal.” The high incidence of weld defects and
high repair rates, even as late as 1967, was a continuing problem.
One of the most frequent defects involved porosity. R. B. Hoppes
described the situation in 1967: “In 144,000 inches [366 000
centimeters] of weld made on four Saturn V first stages, porosity
accounted for 79% of the total number of defects. Cracks ranked
second at 9%.” The nagging problems were solved basically by the
application of <span class="page" id="p397"> </span> some of the
techniques and procedures outlined above, particularly cleanliness.
Contaminants created most of the porosity problems, and Marshall
engineers went back almost step by step through the welding process,
rethinking their approach, and taking special care to eliminate any
instance where contaminants might come into contact with the surfaces
to be welded. It was only by this careful and conservative approach,
rather than through some marvelous breakthrough, that the welding
problems were finally surmounted.<a href="notes.htm#n13.25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Marshall’s experience in solving welding
problems, along with similar information from other NASA programs,
was disseminated through a series of special publications by the NASA
Technology Utilization program. Fourteen published studies, for
example, were sponsored by MSFC through the Battelle Memorial
Institute of Columbus, Ohio. The studies described the problems of
weld porosity and defects and the various steps in welding the
large-scale components that were part of the Saturn V development
program.<a href="notes.htm#n13.26">[26]</a> Other NASA pamphlets resulting from the Apollo-Saturn
program dealt with brazing and brazing alloys, piping and tubing,
seals and sealing, insulation tools and techniques, a technique for
joining and sealing dissimilar metals, and the application of
magnesium lithium alloys. The electromagnetic hammer developed in the
S-IC manufacturing program was used by a number of aircraft and other
metal-working firms, and the contributions of the Saturn program to
general technology included a publication on advanced bearing
designs. The commonplace, but highly useful, parade of developments
and contributions ran the gamut from better adhesives for bonding
auto trim to several different kinds of computer programming, to
spray foam, to new types of pipe, and better ways of doing things in
a wide variety of fields.<a href="notes.htm#n13.27">[27]</a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 1em 0"><i>Saturn in Retrospect</i></p>
<p>There were numerous instances of new
technological developments, some among the Saturn contractors, others
involving both government and industry. The difficulties of Douglas
in trying to find a good substitute for balsa wood in the S-IV and
S-IVB stages is an example. North American took the lead in
perfecting spray-foam insulation for the S-II second stage, including
the special phenolic cutters to trim the stuff once it had cured. On
the other hand, it is virtually impossible to pinpoint all the major
technological innovations in Saturn, then ascribe them to personnel
at Marshall or at some contractor’s plant. Marshall set the
specifications and guidelines, and the contractor produced the
product. MSFC followed its contractors very closely, not only in
paperwork, but also in hardware. Laboratories and test stands at
Huntsville were not just backup facilities, they provided depth and
additional manpower for problems encountered in a joint program. Thus
the F-1 combustion <span class="page" id="p398"> </span> instability problem
was simultaneously tackled from several angles by both NASA and
Rocketdyne. The Saturn program succeeded because complications were
faced and resolved; the mutual goal was to make the vehicles work,
and they did.</p>
<p>The whole field of cryogenics changed as a
result of the Saturn program, with government and industry
cooperating on a number of problems. For one thing, there was the
sheer volume of production of cryogenic materials, storage,
transportation, and many technical problems of piping it from one
point to another at test sites and at the launch pad. Computer
operations and related software were affected by the influence of
Saturn requirements for test, checkout, and launch, which led, among
other things, to the new computer language called ATOLL (Acceptance
Test or Launch Language). Demands for unparalleled compactness and
reliability in Saturn guidance and control resulted in instrument
unit innovations such as unit logic devices and triple modular
redundancy. As a part of the effort to keep weight at the minimum,
guidance and control components in the instrument unit were
fabricated from beryllium and magnesium-lithium alloys, the first
application of these materials, which are difficult to work with, in
the space program.</p>
<p>The unusually large dimensions of Saturn
components posed recurrent complications. In developing the S-IC
stage, production of the large skin panels depended on refinement of
existing techniques of metals fabrication and forming, but even more
in the manner and utilization of oversized tooling never accomplished
before. In fact, in dealing with the technology of the Saturns in
general, the most consistent factor seemed to be the enormous size of
the vehicles. Time after time, when engineers and technicians were
pressed to define what was “new” about the Saturn, what fantastic new
technological techniques were applied in its development, personnel
would shake their heads and invariably comment on
size.<a href="notes.htm#n13.28">[28]</a> Size was a factor in tooling as well as in welding
exotic space-age alloys, especially in the case of the S-II stage.
Even though every attempt was made to use off-the-shelf hardware and
existing technology, Saturn’s size implied new requirements and new
complications. It just was not possible, for example, to take an H-1
engine and easily uprate it to the thrust of an F-1 engine. The
extrapolation of existing technology simply did not work when the
engines got into the operational regimes of higher flow rates,
pressures, and the associated wear and tear on the engine
machinery.</p>
<p>Saturn logistics generated unexpected
difficulties. Prior to the Saturn program, rockets could be moved
from factory to test site to launch pad by conventional means, such
as available highway, water, or air transport. Saturn used these
transport modes as well, but required oversized equipment,
custom-built or modified for the job.</p>
<p>In terms of management, NASA seems to have
borrowed, albeit with permutations, bits and pieces of managerial
techniques from industry, <span class="page" id="p399"> </span> business, and the
military. What NASA (and particularly Marshall Space Flight Center)
apparently added was “visibility,” in terms of progress and problems,
as well as of the individual responsible for handling these aspects.
Visibility, both for the product and for personnel, was the prime
concern of the Program Control Center of Arthur Rudolph’s Saturn V
Program Office. Its success in tracking the myriad bits and pieces of
Saturn vehicles impressed even NASA Administrator Webb, who prided
himself on managerial techniques and skills. Claiming that MSFC was
unusually thorough in its management may seem like a simplification.
Given the diversity of the prime contractors and their armies of
subcontractors and vendors, however, the clockwork efficiency and the
reliability of the Saturn vehicles were remarkable. Meticulous
attention to details, and keeping track of them, was a hallmark of
MSFC.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that even after the Saturn
V program was over, MSFC still received many requests from businesses
and managers asking “how did you do it?” Here again it is probably
wise to remember Bauer’s admonition that space management, just like
space hardware, has been frequently developed to meet particular and
complex problems, not always compatible with the outside, or
commercial, world.</p>
<p>In retrospect it seems that the impact of the
Saturn program, in terms of spinoff, was best observed in improved
industrial technique, in basic shop practices, and in the frequently
prosaic but necessary areas of how to run machine tools, how to bend
tubes, how to make and apply fasteners, and simply how to get around
in a machine shop. This was part of Marshall’s heritage anyhow. It
must be remembered that the von Braun team came directly out of the
Army tradition of the in-house arsenal philosophy, and that Marshall
not only built the first of the Saturn I vehicles, but the first few
S-IC first stages as well. Even though they did not get into the
construction of S-II, S-IV, and S-IVB stages and their engines,
Marshall consistently retained the in-house capability of duplicating
test programs and even major parts of such hardware. As Lee James
noted, it was difficult to make this kind of concept acceptable, and
work effectively with the contractor. Marshall somehow carried it
off.</p>
<p>The Apollo-Saturn program frequently used the
overworked phrase, “government-industry team” in explaining how the
Saturn program was carried out successfully. It would be easy to
underestimate this phrase as a bit of public relations flak put out
by the space centers as well as the manufacturers themselves. Such
does not seem to be the case. It was not unusual, in the course of
interviews with contractor and NASA personnel, to name someone who
had been interviewed previously on a related topic. The mention would
bring about a quick smile and a brightening of the eyes and a
response like “Oh, do you know so and so? Yes, we worked
on…,” followed by one or two anecdotes indicating a feeling of
exceedingly strong partnership. Government and contractor personnel
actually did relate to each other, especially at the technical
levels. This ingredient <span class="page" id="p400"> </span> had to be important
to the success of the program. It meant that individuals could easily
call each other on the phone, discuss a problem, agree on a solution,
and continue the work without major interruption.</p>
<p>The overall success of the Saturn program
depended on a significant number of key decisions. One of these would
have to be the decision in 1957 to start consideration of the
clustered engine concept as a means to get heavy payloads into orbit.
As natural as this concept seems today, it has to be remembered that
the tricky nature and recalcitrant operating characteristics of
rocket engines at that time suggested clustering of two or more
engines would be courting absolute disaster. Next was the decision to
use liquid hydrogen as one of the propellants. The application of
this high-energy fuel made all the difference in the performance of
the Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V vehicles. The use of the fuel
allowed optimum sizing of the stages while keeping the weight to a
minimum, so that a three-astronaut payload could be carried
successfully into orbit and boosted into lunar trajectory. The
controversy of EOR-LOR also stands out as a major period of decision
early in the program. The choice of LOR led to the successful Saturn
IB interim vehicle and stabilized the design configuration of the
Saturn V. Finally, the decision to adopt the all-up concept stands
out as one of the steps that permitted the United States to achieve
the manned lunar landing on the moon before the end of the
1960s.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the von Braun
team argued about the acceptance of three of these four major program
milestones. On the other hand, the argument seems to have been one of
degree rather than one of substance. Despite the strong recollections
of individuals who say that von Braun opposed liquid hydrogen from
the beginning, one must remember that LH₂ had been included
very early by MFSC—in terms of the Centaur upper stage—in some of the
early Saturn system studies.</p>
<p>The collective technological experience of the
Saturn program was effectively applied in planning the Shuttle
program, most notably in the Shuttle’s propellant and propulsion
systems. Marshall’s experience in the handling and pumping of
cryogenics, construction of fuel tanks, and development of the
LH₂
engines were directly applied to the Shuttle
concept.<a href="notes.htm#n13.29">[29]</a></p>
<p>In one respect, the technology of the Saturn
vehicle represented the closing of a circle in international space
partnership and cooperation. Allies in World War II, the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. both borrowed heavily from the technological storehouse of
their defeated foe, Germany. In the early postwar years, both the
U.S. and the U.S.S.R. learned from firing their respective stocks of
captured V-2 rockets and perfected significant sectors of their own
new rocket technology out of the V-2 experience common to both. This
propulsion technology was further elaborated during the Cold War era
along an escalating front of improved ICBM weaponry. When landing on
the moon became an acknowledged race,
<span class="page" id="p401"> </span> both borrowed liberally from the extant technology of
ICBM propulsion systems to build large rocket boosters. Tempered in
wars both hot and cold, the technological heritage of the launch
vehicles that put the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project into orbit could be
traced back to the German technicians of World War II. The former
wartime allies were now closing a technological circle that had
ranged from partners, to protagonists, to partners again, with German
expertise in rocketry as a catalyst.</p>
<p>Partnership in space, by itself, will be no
automatic guarantee of international amity. Partnership in space
exploration may be an exhilarating prospect, however, offering an
additional incentive for international cooperation and peace. If so,
then the Saturn program may count this factor as its most important
legacy.</p>
