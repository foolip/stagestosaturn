<h2>8. From Checkout to Launch: The Quintessential Computer</h2>
<p><span class="page" id="p235"> </span> During World War
II, the growing sophistication of weapon systems and communications
equipment prompted development of test procedures to ensure that
everything was in proper working order. Automatic testing, or
checkout, saved time and reduced the large number of specialists who
would otherwise have to be trained to do the job. In the post-World
War II era, larger and ever more complex missile systems created new
difficulties in testing and monitoring the internal condition of the
missile. Computers were introduced not only to measure the level of
fuel and oxidizer in the tanks, but also to assess propellant
qualities such as temperature, stratification, and boil-off rates.
Continuous monitoring of the condition of propellant machinery,
missile electronics, and various internal rocket systems became
significant functions of computer checkout. The Atlas, the first
American ICBM, used the kind of comprehensive checkout equipment that
would be elaborated in the course of the Apollo-Saturn program. Once
launched, rockets like the Atlas needed precise guidance and control.
Other, smaller computers and associated equipment aboard the vehicle
maintained the proper course and controlled the flow of propellants.
Again, the Apollo-Saturn elaborated on equipment developed for
ICBMs.<a href="notes.htm#n8.1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Computers and their end product devised for Saturn
V—automatic checkout of flight hardware—were much in
evidence at the Kennedy Space Center. This view of the control center,
with row on row of computer consoles, is only one portion of the
system.</p>
</div>
<h3>Automatic Checkout</h3>
<p>“A check-out system is considered automatic”
according to one definition, “when it can, to some degree,
autonomously sequence a series <span class="page" id="p236"> </span> of measurements of
equipment outputs and comparisons of these measurements against
standards.” A manual test system, on the other hand, required the
operator to switch the equipment from one reading to a different one
and to make comparisons on “go/no-go” conditions. For NASA engineers,
the intricacy and enormity of measurement and comparison was evident
by taking a look at the number of comparison test points in the
Apollo-Saturn vehicle. Vanguard, produced by Martin, required only
about 600 test points. The Apollo spacecraft, on the other hand,
included over 2500 test points on the command module and the lunar
module, and another 5000 on the Saturn itself. Further, these test
points were checked and monitored constantly from early manufacturing
checkout sequences, to pre-static-firing checkout, to
post-static-firing checkout. Test points were checked scores of times
in the 12–14 weeks required prior to a launch for complete checkout
of the Apollo-Saturn stack at Cape Kennedy. Without computer
technology, such procedures, even at the launch site, might have
stretched out the checkout procedures for more than a
year.<a href="notes.htm#n8.2">[2]</a> Checkout equipment and procedures went beyond the
point of merely pinpointing a fault in the equipment. The automated
checkout paraphernalia associated with the Apollo-Saturn program
additionally incorporated a diagnosis function; computer or screen
readouts would indicate to the test engineers and programmers not
only that a problem existed, but also the nature of the problem, its
causes, and possible solutions.<a href="notes.htm#n8.3">[3]</a></p>
<p>In the evolution of automated checkout
equipment, one of the most interesting problems centered on the
creation of a new language. The language tapes incorporated in the
computer programs had to be functional for the designer of the
vehicle as well as the test engineer. Readouts on malfunctions had to
make sense to persons reworking the piece of hardware that failed or
had not performed properly. Obviously,
<span class="page" id="p237"> </span> each of these
individuals came to the language problem from a different background
and with a different goal in mind. Melding two such disciplines
together was not always an easy task. Earlier in the Saturn program,
Marshall Space Flight Center had developed two separate languages for
computer operations—one for stage testing and one for launch site
operations. This situation obviously created communications problems
and was complicated by the fact that each of the stage manufacturers
was also using its own computer language based on the particular
requirements of its own test designers and engineers. A further
entanglement involved the rapid evolution of checkout programs. Test
engineers were putting new demands on the computers, and these new
demands as well as the style of language had to be communicated to
the programmer. To arrive at an appropriate language, either the test
engineer had to learn more about programming, or the programmer had
to learn more about test engineering. The solution to this dilemma
was ATOLL, an acronym for Acceptance Test or Launch Language,
designed to bridge many of the gaps between the test engineer, the
designer of the stage, and the computer programmer. Originating in
late 1963, ATOLL eased confusion and helped to normalize the many
functions of automatic test and checkout encountered at the
manufacturer’s plant, during static firing, and during operations at
the launch site.<a href="notes.htm#n8.4">[4]</a></p>
<p>In a typical test sequence a number of things
happened. For example, the test engineer inaugurated the program by
typing in the instructions on his console. The computer responded by
reading out for the test engineer the status of the selected program.
When the program was ready for running, this was indicated on the
appropriate panel of the computer. The information appeared in
English on either the cathode tube of the program display or on a
video data terminal. Perhaps the display also included numerous
options for the engineer, depending on which portions of the test he
wanted to pursue at the time. If some selected part of the test
required a further breakdown for the engineer’s consideration,
instructions could also be typed in, and the computer would respond
on the display tube. When either programming difficulties or hardware
problems cropped up, the computer might give the test engineer a
choice of several actions: terminate the test, go back to a prior
enumerated step, proceed, or some other option. Further, in the
process of running the test, all the results were shown on
engineering display consoles and recorded both in print and on
magnetic tape. These readouts were stored and, in some instances,
were correlated into previous test operations for checking at some
later date. Thereafter, if an anomaly occurred, it was possible to
run a check through the computer all the way back to the machine shop
floor to see what discrepancies or difficulties might have occurred
in the test conditions, hardware, or in the manufacturing process
itself.<a href="notes.htm#n8.5">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="page" id="p238"> </span> Prior to the
static-firing program (and before any mating of the separate stages
occurred), each Saturn stage had to pass checkout requirements.
Although the final test goals were similar for each stage, the
differences between stages required a “custom-tailored” test for each
one. Designing a checkout system to satisfy the unique requirements
of the instrument unit and each stage, and also meet integrated
vehicle requirements, became what MSFC called a “major task.” The
Marshall group drew on its experience with the Redstone, Jupiter,
Mercury, Saturn I, and other rocket programs in establishing the
checkout organization.<a href="notes.htm#n8.6">[6]</a></p>
<h3>Saturn Automatic Checkout</h3>
<p>The decision to use automated stage checkout
for the Saturn program rested on several factors. D. M. Schmidt, of
MSFC’s Quality and Reliability Assurance Laboratory, summarized them
at a technical conference in New York City in 1965:</p>
<ul>
<li>High reliability is needed; vehicle is
expensive and is man-rated.
</li><li>Truly integrated designs of stages and
support equipment would reduce the number of operational
problems.
</li><li>Human errors and human slowness must be
improved upon.
</li><li>An engineering approach is feasible
throughout design, production and test, military restraints being
absent.
</li><li>The time scheduled for checkout must be
used more effectively than on previous programs.
</li><li>The volume of technical data to be
measured and handled is extremely large; each flight stage alone
has hundreds of measuring devices aboard (perhaps as high as
1000).
</li><li>All data must be transmitted long
distances on a limited number of channels. Launch pads are far
from control consoles. Stage checkout must meet launch
needs.
</li><li>Test and launch data must be retrieved,
stored, and made available to many organizations.
</li><li>Automation increases the powers of human
operators to deal with complex situations and frees them for
decision-making.
</li><li>Data-handling needs are many and varied:
accuracy of measurements and transmission, versatility of
equipment, speed of operation, operating-time recording, failure
histories, data comparisons.<a href="notes.htm#n8.7">[7]</a>
</li></ul>
<p>For the Saturn program, checkout included two
distinct phases. “Stage checkout” included test sequences conducted
on the individual stage during manufacturing and static firing prior
to NASA’s acceptance for assembly into the launch vehicle. “Vehicle
checkout” included tests on the assembled launch vehicle at the
launch site. A complete checkout of the stack was deemed necessary
because an individual stage might function perfectly in tests that
simulated interaction with other stages, but not function as well
when linked together physically in the stack.
<span class="page" id="p239"> </span> Marshall’s main interest was the actual stage
checkout, with responsibility for final launch vehicle checkout
resting with Kennedy Space Center. Originally, NASA planners
envisioned repeating the stage checkout after the delivery of each
stage to Cape Kennedy, but it became apparent that this scheme
compromised the time and resources required for final checkout and
launch. Therefore each stage received final checkout before transport
to the launch site. The procedure not only made it easier to
accomplish the final checkout and launch, but enabled MSFC and the
contractors to deal more efficiently with problem areas at the stage
test facility (where specialized personnel and equipment were
present). This concept paid off on the first three Saturn V vehicles
when stage checkouts uncovered 40 serious defects; these flaws would
have gone undetected had the stage checkout depended only on
procedures and facilities available at the launch
site.<a href="notes.htm#n8.8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Each booster stage was subjected to a
post-manufacturing checkout, a checkout prior to static-firing tests,
and a post-static-firing checkout. Static firing, the most dramatic
test, tested the propulsion systems during actual ignition and
operation. Checkout featured a “building-block” sequence, common to
all stages, with variations as necessary for an individual stage. A
typical sequence began with an independent electrical system test and
was followed by a simplified rundown of the launch sequence. Next,
other systems were run in succession; guidance and control system
tests; a second launch sequence run with these and other electrical
and propulsion systems tested; completion of ancillary system tests;
an all-systems test; and, finally, a “simulated flight” test,
including ignition and a duration burn.<a href="notes.htm#n8.9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The Saturn stages and the associated checkout
equipment for each were developed simultaneously with the goal of an
integrated design of the vehicle and its ground equipment. Some of
the vehicle’s mechanical equipment—such as sensing equipment for
checkout of a number of items operated by fluid, as well as fluid
management subsystems—did not lend themselves to checkout with
digital computers. Design engineers succeeded in developing suitable
checkout equipment for the electrically actuated and measured
equipment so that the great majority of stage checkout tests would
proceed automatically. The Saturn I vehicles offered the first
experiences in stage checkout for Saturn class vehicles. Whereas the
vehicle SA-1 required manual checkout, by the end of the Saturn
series automatic equipment controlled over 50 percent of the tests.
The automatic capability improved during the S-IB vehicle series, and
checkout of the Saturn V stages, including the instrument unit (IU),
was about 90 percent automated.<a href="notes.htm#n8.10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Checkout equipment for S-II and S-IVB stages
of the Saturn V was developed by the stage contractors under the
direction of MSFC. For the S-IC, Marshall collaborated with Boeing in
developing the automated equipment, because the first S-IC stages
were fabricated in MSFC shops <span class="page" id="p240"> </span> at Huntsville.
Boeing employees trained on the first two S-IC stages at Huntsville,
then checked out later stages at Michoud. For the IU, checkout
equipment previously developed by Marshall for the Saturn I was
utilized, with IBM in Huntsville assuming responsibility for later
work. The S-IC stage and the IU checkout operations both utilized the
RCA-110A digital computer. NASA had already decided to use the
RCA-110A for launch control, so the interfaces with the S-IC and IU
were compatible. In contrast, the S-II and S-IVB stages relied on the
CDC-924A computer, supplied by Control Data Corporation. The design
of this computer offered added flexibility for checkout of the two
upper stages, which utilized liquid hydrogen as fuel, mounted the J-2
engine, ignited at high altitude, and included several unique design
features. Also the CDC-924A, which was based on later-generation
computer technology, offered added test
functions.<a href="notes.htm#n8.11">[11]</a> The Saturn program also relied heavily on the “Saturn
V Systems Breadboard,” a facility located at MSFC. The breadboard
incorporated both mechanical equipment and electronic simulation and
was used for wringing out the checkout procedures and launch control
operations at the Cape.<a href="notes.htm#n8.12">[12]</a> </p>
<p>Not everyone was happy about the escalating
preeminence of automation. Many of Douglas’s own people opposed the
ubiquitous computer. “In fact,” an automation expert at Douglas
admitted, “the company was surprised to find that its equipment took
the automation more readily than did its
engineers.”<a href="notes.htm#n8.13">[13]</a></p>
<p>In the pre-Saturn days of rocket and missile
operations, many checkout procedures were performed manually and
worked well with complex vehicles like the Thor-Delta. Douglas
engineers used manual checkout techniques for the earliest S-IV
stages; pre-checkout, acceptance firing, and post-checkout required a
total of 1200 hours per stage. Veteran “switch flippers,” who for so
long scanned gauges and dials, flipping the right switch in a
critical situation, had been vital links in the overall loop. They
were now replaced by ranks of gray-enameled computers. For checkout
procedures on the Saturn V third stage, the S-IVB, fully automated
techniques replaced the manual checkout for the first time. Although
the magnitude of testing rose by 40 percent per stage, the new
automated systems reduced the checkout time to about 500 hours
total. H. E. Bauer clearly remembered the occasion when men and the
new machines first confronted each other. “One seasoned switch
flipper came into the blockhouse after the equipment was installed;
he watched the blinking lights, the scanners, the recorders—everything
was working automatically, heaving out wide and endless
runs of data printouts…” The man balefully surveyed the
mechanically throbbing interloper and growled, “It’s the Gray Puke!”
It was not an isolated reaction. As Bauer recalls, the ghastly name
stuck and became part of the permanent lexicon associated with the
S-IVB stage.</p>
<p>Even with mechanical drones like the Gray Puke
usurping the <span class="page" id="p241"> </span> human role, the
man-behind-the-machine could still display some semblance of
individuality. Consider, for example, the case of the petulant
computer-printer—when the machine apparently took umbrage during the
automatic checkout sequence in preparation for an acceptance firing.
The moment of truth for the test arrived—the signal to fire. After
uncounted hours of preparation, hundreds of workers now stood by to
observe the climactic moment of ignition. In the crowded blockhouse,
all eyes focused on the rows of computers and monitor screens
displaying their last fragments of information. Finally, the test
conductor typed in his “request” to start the terminal countdown for
static firing. The computer whirred, and the automatic typewriter
responded with a singular reply, “Say please.” Startled, the test
conductor concluded he had made a typing error, and repeated his
original message more carefully. The balky computer was not to be
denied. “Say please,” it insisted. At this point the crowd in the
blockhouse began stirring restlessly. The loaded S-IVB, readied for
firing, remained poised nearby with thousands of gallons of liquid
oxygen and liquid hydrogen primed for detonation. People were getting
tense. Reasonably certain he was only working against a faulty firing
tape, the test conductor quickly decided to make one more try, rather
than put it into discard and risk more precious time to put a
replacement tape into operation. So once more, he entered into the
machine his humble request to fire, with a polite notation at the
end: “please.” This time, there was no problem. “This is your
programmer,” the machine chattered back, “wishing you good luck.” And
with a roar, the rocket ignited.<a href="notes.htm#n8.14">[14]</a></p>
<h3>Guidance and Control</h3>
<p>With computer data accumulated for each stage
and subsystem, the collected information was not only utilized for
vehicle checkout at the Cape, but also for the launch and for
guidance and control during the mission.</p>
<p>After years of research and development on the
individual stages, involving thousands of workers and millions of
man-hours, most of the responsibility for the six-hour flight of a
Saturn V devolved on a piece of equipment known as the instrument
unit—the “IU.” A thin, circular structure, only 1 meter high and 7.6
meters in diameter, the IU was sandwiched between the S-IVB stage and
the command and service modules. Packed inside were the computers,
gyroscopes, and assorted “black boxes” necessary to keep the launch
vehicle properly functioning and on its course.</p>
<p>Historically, the problems of traveling
successfully from point A to point B on the Earth’s surface depended
on some form of visual references, such as tall trees, mountains, or
some other easily sighted <span class="page" id="p242"> </span> landmark. Longer
journeys overland, where familiar landmarks were unavailable, and
extensive sea voyages, out of sight of any landmarks at all, came to
rely on guidance instruments such as compasses and the astrolabe.
Rocket vehicles, on the other hand, with their extremely high speeds,
altitudes, and long-range capabilities, came to depend on advanced
guidance systems coupled with control systems that were essentially
automatic. </p>
<p>The Saturn rockets relied on inertial
guidance, involving a rigid member within the vehicle. This member,
an integral element of the guidance package, was oriented and held
unchanging by means of gyro units, gimbal systems, and
servomechanisms. Additional equipment tied into the inertial guidance
unit contained all the data needed to sense the distance traveled by
the vehicle and the deviations from the desired path and to control
the vehicle in accordance with its computer
memory.<a href="notes.htm#n8.15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The guidance and control techniques applied in
the Saturn program involved many problems. Successful solutions were
reached partly through new research and development and partly
through the use of proven techniques and hardware adapted from
existing systems. The Saturn digital computer and the data adapter
stand out as new developments. The inertial platform, on the other
hand, was a result of concepts and hardware worked out in the late
1930s and early 1940s in Germany.</p>
<p>Inertial guidance rested on the technology of
precision gyroscopes. Gyroscope technology progressed considerably
during World War I, based on requirements for controlling the gunfire
of long-range naval guns at sea. During the 1920s and the 1930s,
further development of gyroscopic systems involved aircraft
applications, which included rate-of-turn indicators, the artificial
horizon, and the directional gyro. Despite the remarkable advances in
aviation guidance instruments for navigation and “blind flying,”
instrument precision and response rates were inadequate for
application in high-speed rocket vehicles. New developments were
required in gimbal systems, servomechanisms, electronics, computers,
and other equipment leading to inertial guidance systems for rockets
and missiles. An intensive effort to perfect such hardware occurred
in the late 1930s and during World War II, particularly through the
work accomplished in missile research by the von Braun team in
Germany. C. Stark Draper, a leading postwar specialist in the field
of guidance and control, acknowledged the contributions of the von
Braun team in no uncertain terms. “Beyond doubt,” he declared,
“credit for the realization of inertial guidance belongs to the
Peenemuende group of German scientists who developed the V-2
ballistic rocket missile.”<a href="notes.htm#n8.16">[16]</a></p>
<p>In the A-4 missile (the V-2), a pair of gyros
was used in a guidance system known as the LEV-3; one free gyro
controlled roll and yaw, one controlled pitch, and a tilt program put
the missile into the proper angular attitude after its vertical
launch. The LEV-3 employed a gyro-type accelerometer as a propulsion
cutoff system, the device being preset
<span class="page" id="p243"> </span> to cut off the engines when the missile reached a
predetermined velocity. With this pair of two-degree-of-freedom
gyros, the LEV-3 was a three-axis-stabilized platform (an inertial
guidance concept), the result of very high quality research and
development in precision machinery, materials, advanced theory, and
innovative design concepts. Moreover, the whole system was
manufactured in quantity.<a href="notes.htm#n8.17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The LEV-3 was a milestone in the art of
guidance and control for rockets; it established the basic design
concepts for the inertial guidance concepts that followed during V-2
development in wartime Germany.<a href="notes.htm#n8.18">[18]</a> One of the most significant developments occurred
through the work of Fritz Mueller, at Kreissel Geralte GMB. H. This
was the SG-66, a three-axis platform with advanced accelerometers and
integrators. Boasting much improved precision and accuracy, it was
coming into production for use in German missile systems when the war
ended. After the von Braun group moved to Huntsville, Mueller
directed further refinements of advanced V-2 guidance concepts
developed at Peenemuende which ultimately resulted in a far superior
piece of equipment. The new variant featured an air-bearing system
for three single-degree-of-freedom gyros integrated in a gimbal-ring
structure; this yielded a three-axis stabilized platform. Further
work by other Peenemuende veterans and an analog guidance computer
devised with American researchers at the Redstone Arsenal culminated
in the ST-80, the stabilized platform, inertial guidance system
installed in the Army’s 1954 Redstone missile. Prior to launch, the
intended flight profile was fed into the missile’s computer guidance
program. During flight the ST-80 combined with the guidance computer
kept the missile on its preplanned trajectory with no external
guidance influences.<a href="notes.htm#n8.19">[19]</a></p>
<p>The ST-80 of the Redstone evolved into
Jupiter’s ST-90 (1957); both were turned over to the Ford Instrument
Company for manufacture. When the Saturn I began to evolve, the Army
Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) guidelines called for the use of
proven and available hardware wherever possible. For example, the
early Saturns incorporated the ST-90 stabilized platform with an IBM
computer, the ASC-15 model, adapted from the equipment used on the
uprated Titan II.<a href="notes.htm#n8.20">[20]</a> At a later date, as other vehicle test milestones were
passed, a different guidance and control unit was proposed. This new
unit, the ST-124, was an improved inertial guidance platform intended
for the Saturn V’s complex and long-term orbital mission.</p>

<h3>Evolution of the IU</h3>
<p>The instrument unit (IU) evolved as an
“in-house” project at Marshall Space Flight Center and was based on
the guidance expertise
<span class="page" id="p244"> </span> accumulated from the V-2, the Redstone,
and subsequent vehicles developed by the von Braun team.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1958, work on the IU was
concurrent with the Saturn I. On 15 June 1961, the mockup of the IU
was completed at Huntsville and scheduled to fly in the Block II
series of the Saturn launch vehicles.<a href="notes.htm#n8.21">[21]</a> For the Block I vehicles with dummy upper stages,
guidance and control equipment was packaged in canisters located at
various points in the adapter area atop the S-I first stage of the
Saturn I. This equipment included telemetry, tracking, and other
components, such as the ST-90 guidance platform and a guidance signal
processor. Plans called for an additional canister to carry the
ST-124 platform as a “passenger,” thus beginning its sequential tests
and qualification as the active guidance component for later Saturn
I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V flights.</p>
<p>MSFC intended to make the ST-124 an
increasingly active system for SA-5 and subsequent vehicles and to
link it with an IBM computer. SA-5 was the first of the Block II
vehicles of the Saturn I series. It featured a live S-IV upper stage
and a separate vehicle segment, located above the S-IV, for guidance
and control (to be known as the IU). Standing about 1.5 meters high,
the cylindrical IU section contained four package bays that had been
shaped in the form of large tubes and cruciformly joined in the
center. This new structural element was
<span class="page" id="p245"> </span> designed for greater flexibility and permitted
modifications between launches, if so dictated by results of the
previous launch and changing test requirements. The four tubular
segments contained the ST-90, the ST-124, the telemetry equipment,
and the power and control package.<a href="notes.htm#n8.22">[22]</a></p>
<p>With the flight of SA-9, the Saturn I vehicles
began carrying a new type of instrument unit, which resembled the
equipment later applied in the Saturn IB and Saturn V flights. In the
earlier design, the tubular package bays were pressurized and
surrounded by an inert gas as a means of environmental control to
cope with the problems of heat. In later instrument unit design,
however, equipment was mounted on the walls of the cylindrical
segment. With this design the cylindrical unit was not pressurized,
and the external style of environmental control by inert gas gave way
to a revised system. Elimination of the pressurized tubular sections
and other simplifications not only reduced the weight of the
instrument unit, but also reduced the height of the segment by half,
thereby improving the structural and flight characteristics of the
late Block II launch vehicles. Introduction of the improved
instrument unit marked growing participation of contractors,
including the Bendix Corporation, for the ST-124, and IBM, who
assumed increasing responsibility for the instrument unit segment and
various guidance components.<a href="notes.htm#n8.23">[23]</a></p>
<p>The major role of IBM as the principal
manufacturer for the instrument unit began in February 1964. The
company was named prime contractor for both the Saturn IB and Saturn
V versions of the IU and was responsible for building, testing, and
shipping the instrument unit to Cape Kennedy. With MSFC retaining
primary responsibility for the buildup of the first four units and
the first four flights of the Saturn IB, IBM was able to ease into
its work. For the first instrument unit, 80 percent of the hardware
was classed as government-furnished equipment; this was reduced to 10
percent when IBM took over for the fifth unit. The instrument unit
for the Saturn V was essentially the same as the model for the Saturn
IB, because the evolutionary process of development and manufacturing
was intended to give the Saturn V a proven piece of equipment with as
few changes as possible.<a href="notes.htm#n8.24">[24]</a> </p>
<p>Unlike most major launch vehicle components,
which were manufactured elsewhere around the country, the instrument
unit was produced in Huntsville. IBM made a major commitment in
setting up complete research and development facilities, engineering
offices, and production facilities in the city’s Research Park.
Although the company started with only a sales office building in
Huntsville in 1962 and originally assumed most of its work would be
done in New York, the scope of work implied a need for new
facilities, and IBM decided on a complex in Huntsville. By 1964, IBM
completed a manufacturing building in Huntsville’s Research Park, and
the company site included four major buildings, representing a $14
million investment with a work force of 2000. Clinton H. Grace, the
facility manager at Huntsville, was a <span class="page" id="p247"> </span> dynamic force
in both the organization and buildup of the IBM complex and won high
praise from Wernher von Braun. Speaking at the dedication of the IBM
facility in 1965, von Braun commented, “In this project, a saying has
developed at Marshall Center, ‘When you’re in trouble, say ‘Grace’—and
Grace will take care of your problems.’”<a href="notes.htm#n8.25">[25]</a></p>
<p>The ground rules for the design, research, and
development of the IU came out of MSFC, and these concepts carried
over into the production models delivered by IBM. With cost
constraints and tight schedules limiting the number of test flights,
the number of measurements for each flight was expected to be quite
high and to vary considerably from one flight to another. For this
reason, flexibility for the instrument unit had a high priority and
designers emphasized a modular approach as means to provide both
flexibility and ease of servicing. Another strongly emphasized
feature was reliability; a key factor, particularly because the
Saturn program was geared to manned launches. In addition, liability
was enforced by the high cost of each vehicle and limited test
flights, which naturally produces a reluctance to fly exotic,
untried, hardware. As James T. Powell, of Marshall’s Astrionics
Laboratory stressed, “We simply cannot afford the time or money to
launch additional vehicles to obtain data lost by instrumentation
equipment failures. This has led to a rather conservative approach to
system design.” Some innovations, such as new modulation techniques
or micro-miniaturization, might turn out to be “equivalent in
importance to the invention of the wheel,” Powell remarked, but would
not be used in the Saturn program until they had undeniably
demonstrated their operational reliability.<a href="notes.htm#n8.26">[26]</a> Nevertheless, the scope of the missions for Saturn V
required additional changes and improvements. These alterations were
introduced and checked out during the Saturn IB series, which not
only carried the same basic instrument unit as the Saturn V but also

<h3>The Brain and Its Parts</h3>
<p>Categorized as the “brain” and “nerve center”
by the MSFC Astrionics Laboratory, the IU, with its modular
construction, facilitated the changing of components and computer
programs, without major modifications, for different missions. The
basic functions of the IU included guidance and control during all
phases of flight; command and sequence of vehicle functions,
including engine cutoff and separation of the stages; insertion into
orbit; and relay of data on vehicle position, vehicle functions, and
other information to ground stations. In the case of the Saturn V,
the IU also functioned in (1) the transfer of the S-IVB, the IU, and
the command and service modules into the lunar transfer trajectory;
(2) the stabilization during transposition and docking; and (3) the
<span class="page" id="p248"> </span> maneuvers to clear the S-IVB and IU from the flight
path of the CSM on its route to the moon.<a href="notes.htm#n8.27">[27]</a> The IU itself was viewed as five major systems:
structural, guidance and control, electrical, instrumentation, and
environmental control.</p>
<p>The cylindrical IU structure did more than
carry meters of cables, black boxes, and other miscellaneous
paraphernalia; it was a load-bearing structure as well, with three
major rocket stages stacked beneath it and thousands of kilograms of
spacecraft, lunar landing module (and three astronauts) to support
above it. The process of assembly of the IU began with three curved
(120°) structural segments made of thin aluminum sheets bonded
over an aluminum honeycomb core (approximately equal to the thickness
of a bar of soap). In joining the three segments together, workers
used highly accurate theodolites, much like a surveyor’s transit, to
align the three segments in a precise circle. Technicians joined the
segments with precision-machined splice plates and affixed aluminum
alloy channel rings for surface mating of both the S-IVB below and
the payload above.<a href="notes.htm#n8.28">[28]</a></p>
<p>The key items for guidance and control
included the ST-124 stabilized platform, the launch vehicle digital
computer, and the launch vehicle data adapter. Produced by the
Navigation and Control Division of the Bendix Corporation, the ST-124
consisted of a three-degrees-of-freedom inertial platform. With a
diameter of 53 centimeters and a weight of 52 kilograms, the
platform’s structural members and most of its components were
fabricated of beryllium, an extremely lightweight space-age metal.
Although difficult to work with, beryllium offered significant weight
savings and provided good stability over a wide temperature range. To
reduce errors in sensing attitude and velocity, designers cut
friction to a minimum in the platform gyros and accelerometers by
floating the bearings on a thin film of dry nitrogen; pressure,
temperature, and rate of flow were controlled from a reservoir in the
IU. The carefully controlled alignment of the ST-124 platform did not
take place until the final events of the launch countdown. The
procedure called for a precisely sited theodolite not far from the
launch pad to aim a beam of light through a small opening in the IU
high above the ground. The beam passed through a small window in the
guidance platform where a pair of platform prisms reflected the beam
back to the theodolite. Coated to work with two different
wavelengths, the prisms aided in aligning the platform to its launch
azimuth; when proper alignment was achieved, the acquisition light
signal notified the mission control center.<a href="notes.htm#n8.29">[29]</a></p>
<p>All the carefully engineered complexities of
the Saturn guidance and control system were not fully employed during
the first-stage burn. Although the ST-124 was released from its
Earth-fixed reference to a space-fixed reference five seconds before
liftoff and was supplying velocity and attitude data to the guidance
computer during the first-stage burn, the vehicle did not require an
active guidance system during the <span class="page" id="p249"> </span> boost phase. In
ascent through the atmosphere, both the Saturn IB and Saturn V were
subject to possible sudden stresses from gusts, wind shear, and jet
streams. If the guidance computer, acting on signals from the
stabilized platform, attempted to generate compensation maneuvers
during such turbulence, the added stress forces from the powerful
engines as they went through extensive gimbaling motions might cause
the rocket to break up. So, during the first-stage burn, the rocket
flew according to a predetermined program stored in its guidance
computer. If the vehicle was forced off its predetermined path, the
ST-124 sensed this displacement and fed the data into the computer
for later retrieval. During the second- and third-stage burns, the
stored data were run through the computer and into the active
guidance and control system to put the rocket back on
course.<a href="notes.htm#n8.30">[30]</a></p>
<p>Information on yaw, pitch, roll, and
acceleration provided by the ST-124, as well as inputs from other
electrical systems, were collectively assimilated and processed by
the digital computer and the data adapter to give the rocket an
optimum performance. There was a division of labor involved. The
computer took information and provided commands such as orbital
checkout of the vehicle. The adapter performed as an input-output
unit in conjunction with the digital computer, interfacing with
nearly all units of the astrionics system. Its digital section
“buffered” the digital quantities, and an analog section converted
analog to digital form and back again. The IU equipment for Saturn V
was only slightly heavier and larger than that for the Saturn I, but
its computer-data adapter combination was three times faster,
possessed four times the storage capacity, and was far more reliable.
Although there were seven times the number of electronic components
in the Saturn V versions, their total power consumption was 100 watts
less than in the Saturn I. Furthermore, the 460 000-bit storage
design could be easily doubled by plugging in additional memory
modules. The following table offers a quick
comparison:<a href="notes.htm#n8.31">[31]</a></p>

<p>These statistical improvements do more than
illustrate the significant changes in the IU for the Saturn IB/V, as
compared with the Saturn <span class="page" id="p250"> </span> I. They also reveal
that, although original guidelines called for as little new equipment
as possible, the nature of manned missions and the quest for
reliability called for advanced design techniques. To meet the
stringent reliability and operational requirements and also remain
within the rigid size and weight limitations, four new design
concepts were incorporated into the computer: a duplex memory system,
unit logic devices, triple modular redundancy, and a liquid-cooled
magnesium-lithium chassis.<a href="notes.htm#n8.32">[32]</a></p>
<p>The duplex memory system incorporated two
separate sets of memory systems that operated in harmony during
critical phases of the mission. This not only reduced the chances of
system failure but operated so that one memory system could correct
the other if intermittent failure should occur. The system consisted
of six modules operating as pairs of duplex memories, each with 4096
computer words of 28 bits and designed to accept two additional
modules for special mission requirements. The unit logic devices
featured microminiature circuitry, resulting in a smaller, lighter
system, having seven times more components than earlier computers
while operating at three times the speed. Typically, each unit logic
device was produced as a “wafer,” 7.6 millimeters square and 0.71
millimeters thick. A total of 8918 such wafers were mounted on dozens
of “pages,” about 7.6 centimeters square, in the computer.
</p>
<p>Further, the IU featured the first computer
application where all critical circuits in both the computer and data
adapter were triplicated—triple modular redundancy—giving
near-ultimate operative reliability. Designers selected seven
functional sections where catastrophic failure might occur but, for
reasons of reliability, could not be permitted to occur. Each
selected section was then placed in three identical but independent
logic channels. Problems were presented to each module
simultaneously, and the results of each, independently derived, went
to a majority-rule voter circuit. Any dissenting “vote” was discarded
as an error, and the only signal passed along by the voter circuit
consisted of the identical signals from two of the modules. Voting
disagreements did not appreciably slow the system: a worst-case
voting delay would tie up the computer for only 100 nanoseconds
(billionths of a second). Moreover, the computer unit, occupying 0.6
cubic meter and weighing 35 kilograms, could subtract and add (in 82
microseconds) while simultaneously dividing and multiplying (in 328
microseconds).<a href="notes.htm#n8.33">[33]</a></p>
<p>The unusually light weight of the computer was
achieved by the use of a magnesium-lithium alloy chassis, the first
application of this alloy in structural fabrication for an
electronics application. Weight being extremely costly in the upper
stages of a booster, MSFC used the magnesium-lithium alloy
construction, along with an integral cooling system, to save 29
kilograms. In selecting a suitable material, designers turned down
the <span class="page" id="p251"> </span> even lighter
beryllium because of toxicity and technical difficulties in machining
and boring. Magnesium-lithium was still quite light (25 percent less
than conventional magnesium and 50 percent less than aluminum) and
possessed a very high weight-to-strength ratio, good thermal
qualities for operation in space, and minimal transfer of mechanical
vibration.</p>
<p>In addition to sharing with the computer some
similarities in the fabrication and production of the chassis, the
data adapter incorporated concepts similar to those of the computer’s
unit logic devices and triple modular redundancy. The basic function
of the data adapter was that of a “gateway” to the computer for all
elements of the Saturn guidance system. It received inputs from the
ground control computer, radio command channel, telemetry,
multifarious communications from within the vehicle, the inertial
guidance platform, and the flight control computer. For example,
analog inputs from various sensors were taken by the data adapter and
digitized for the computer. Computer outputs were relayed back to the
data adapter for conversion to analog signals as required. If the
signals involved control commands, they went through the analog
flight control computer and were combined with additional signals
from the rate gyros. The resulting output included commands to
activate the engine gimbal systems, thereby changing the direction of
their thrust and the attitude of the launch
vehicle.<a href="notes.htm#n8.34">[34]</a></p>
<p>While some IU equipment maintained the rocket
in flight, other systems were involved in communications, tracking
the booster in trajectory and orbit, and transmitting reams of data
back to the ground. Several tracking and command systems were
employed: an Azusa system measured slant range and vehicle direction
in relation to ground stations; a C-band radar transponder aided
radar ground stations in measuring azimuth, elevation, and range; and
a command and communications system permitted updating of the
computer, performance of tests, addition or deletion of certain
messages, and recall of certain portions of the computer memory bank.
During launch and orbital phases, transducers throughout the vehicle
reported information on vibrations, pressures, temperatures, and
various operations; the measuring and telemetry system transmitted
these data to ground stations. This not only furnished real-time data
on vehicle performance during the mission but provided a means of
checkout for succeeding events, verified commands to the vehicle, and
created a bank of data for later analysis of the vehicle’s overall
performance.<a href="notes.htm#n8.35">[35]</a></p>
<p>The power to run this complex electronic
equipment emanated from four 28-volt DC batteries, which consisted of
special distributors and regulators for both low-voltage components
and higher currents for the ST-124 inertial platform. The electrical
system also included the emergency detection network to analyze
vehicle malfunctions. Depending <span class="page" id="p252"> </span> on the seriousness
of the problem, the emergency detection network either responded with
an automatic abort sequence or gave the astronaut crew and NASA
flight controllers time to assess the situation.</p>
<p>Operation of the IU equipment generated
considerable amounts of heat which had to be transferred away from
the components and dissipated into space. This was the function of
the environmental control system. It consisted of cold plates (as
mounting surfaces for most of the electronic gear), and integral
coolant passages for thermal control of (1) the computer, (2) the
data adapter, (3) the flight control computer, and (4) the ST-124
platform. Heat was dissipated to a coolant mixture, similar to the
antifreeze used in a car (60 percent methanol, 40 percent water),
that was pumped through the 16 cold plates and the integral coolant
passages. An additional 16 cold plates, located in the upper skirt
section of the S-IVB, were also connected to the IU’s coolant pumping
system. Warmed coolant was pumped through a sublimator to reduce its
temperature before it was routed back through the coolant passages
and cold plates. A comparatively simple device, the sublimator
consisted of a water supply to a porous plate with ice frozen in the
pores, because the pores were exposed to the frigid environment of
space. In the course of passage through the sublimator, heat from the
coolant was transferred to the plate, the ice was converted to water
vapor, and the water vapor was dissipated into
space.<a href="notes.htm#n8.36">[36]</a></p>
<h3>Quality Control and Testing</h3>
<p>To ensure trouble-free operation of the
equipment in the IU, IBM established tightly controlled preparation
and installation conditions during assembly of the IU. Tubing,
valves, fittings, components, and subassemblies moved in a steady
steam through various “clean-room” environments for checks and
cleansing to establish minimums of contamination. MSFC specifications
for the clean rooms varied, with increasing stringency ranging from
class I to class IV rooms; this successively reflected greater
requirements for clothing worn by personnel, temperature, humidity,
and particle counts. For most clean-room operations, specifications
allowed no particles greater than 175 microns in the air, although
examination and qualification of some critical items established a
limit of 20 microns—about the diameter of a human hair—and a count of
no more than 6 per cubic meter. Cleaning for super-critical items
included laminar flow work benches, de-ionized water, various
combination of solvents, and ultrasonic systems. Once parts and
assemblies were cleaned and ready for installation, there was the
problem of transferring them from the clean-room environment to the
“dirtier” area of IU assembly. Since the IU was too large to bring
into the clean rooms, IBM <span class="page" id="p253"> </span> decided to take the
clean-room environment to the IU instead. The company used a trio of
mobile clean rooms on casters, which had been hung with heavy vinyl
curtain walls and equipped with air filters and blowers to maintain
class IV working conditions.<a href="notes.htm#n8.37">[37]</a></p>
<p>Installation of equipment within the IU was
accompanied by a series of checkout operations. Beginning with
delivery of individual components, IBM personnel checked them against
equipment specification drawings and subjected them to acceptance
tests, followed by functional checks as items were mounted in the IU.
As the various systems of the IU began to shape up, components and
systems were checked until the IU was complete. Afterward, up to
eight weeks of exhaustive simulation tests were conducted; these
simulations included preflight ground checkouts and others for
liftoff, trajectory, and orbit. When the test and simulation phase
was complete, the IU was ready for shipment. Critical components,
such as the ST-124, the computer, and the data adapter were taken out
and packaged separately, then flown along with the IU to the Cape. At
the Cape, these components were reassembled and rechecked before the
IU was stacked into the rest of the vehicle and prepared for complete
preflight checkout.<a href="notes.htm#n8.38">[38]</a></p>
<p>Despite the great emphasis on clean room
facilities and spotless surroundings, IBM on one occasion finished
production of an IU on the deck of a barge while floating down the
Tennessee and Mississippi rivers. During 1965, work on the IU fell
behind as a result of changes in instrumentation. The schedule for
“stacking” the first Saturn IB (AS-201) for launch early in 1966 was
apparently going to slip badly unless work on the IU could be
accelerated. Marshall executives pressured their own IU project
managers by demanding to know what they were going to do to make the
launch date. Luther Powell and Sidney Sweat, from the IU project
office at MSFC, brainstormed the situation and proposed a way to make
up time. At that point, there was no aircraft large enough to deliver
the IU by air. Instead, the IU was scheduled to be carried to the
Cape via a barge down the Tennessee and Mississippi rivers, one of
the most time-consuming elements in the IU delivery schedule.
</p>
<p>Powell and Sweat proposed finishing the IU
while enroute aboard the barge and submitted their idea to their IBM
counterparts, who agreed with the unlikely proposal. Because the
enclosed barge was equipped with internal environmental controls
anyhow, it was no great problem to set up a workable clean-room
atmosphere by rigging a series of heavy plastic shrouds for
additional environmental control inside the barge canopy. Marshall
and IBM specialists agreed on specific jobs to be done on the barge
so that no critical areas or hardware would be subject to
environmental degradation during the trip. With detailed work
schedules set up, arrangements were made for delivery of key parts
and supplies at designated ports along the river. In case of
unanticipated <span class="page" id="p254"> </span> needs, constant
radio contact with MSFC permitted instantaneous dispatch of a light
plane with emergency deliveries to any nearby airport; there, a
government truck could pick them up and deliver them.</p>
<p>The unusual voyage worked. The IU was complete
by the time it reached New Orleans. The most serious problems proved
to be the physical condition of the traveling IU working team.
Despite 16–18 hour workdays, the meals concocted by the barge’s chef
produced a chubbier group of electronics specialists by the end of
the trip.<a href="notes.htm#n8.39">[39]</a></p>
<p>Barge trips being the exception, an intensive
effort in quality control extended to the fabricating and
manufacturing process and encompassed the subcontractors as well. In
one instance, IBM began having leakage problems with the manifolds
carrying the coolant of the environmental control system. On IU-204,
engineers finally decided to restudy the whole process, since IU-204
was to be on a manned launch of the Saturn IB. Manifolds on other IUs
in production were also removed, because these too were to be used on
man-rated vehicles. The subcontractor, the Solar Division of
International Harvester, had originally dealt with the frustrating
problems of welding the aluminum alloy. During a thorough review of
the procedure, Solar found that only minor variances in the use of
the welding fixtures created the difficulties and thereafter imposed
even stricter procedures for this crucial
operation.<a href="notes.htm#n8.40">[40]</a> In spite of the constant theme of using proven
hardware and systems, the different requirements of the Saturn
program called forth some new equipment and attendant “teething”
problems. Not infrequently, IBM sent delegations to vendors and
subcontractors to help work out problems in quality control, welding,
and soldering.<a href="notes.htm#n8.41">[41]</a> In coping with these situations, IBM also called on
MSFC technicians for assistance. A particularly dramatic instance
occurred during the summer of 1967, when MSFC discovered cracks in
the solder joints of the flight computer for IU-502, and IBM
simultaneously discovered the same problem on IU-503. The discovery
was unsettling for two reasons. In the first place, the units had
already been man-rated and qualified for flight; the soldering
problem should not have occurred. Second, the same kind of unit was
already placed in vehicle AS-501, which was at Cape Kennedy being
readied for the first launch of a Saturn V later in the year. Calling
from Huntsville to NASA’s Apollo Program Office, MSFC’s Chief of
Industrial Operations, Edmund O’Connor, warned Phillips in
Washington: “Right now there is no impact, but this is potentially
serious.” It was decided to continue the checkout of AS-501 at the
Cape, while sending a spare computer to the manufacturer, Electronics
Communications Incorporated, for teardown, inspection, and rework of
many of the solder joints. In this operation, technicians used a
technique worked out by MSFC personnel in collaboration with their
counterparts at the vendor’s plant.<a href="notes.htm#n8.42">[42]</a></p>
<h3>Stage Separation and Ordnance</h3>
<p><span class="page" id="p255"> </span> For a Saturn V
launch, the vehicle really began “thinking on its own” five seconds
before liftoff when the IU was activated. The vehicle’s control
system first executed a series of time-programmed attitude maneuvers.
After rising vertically for about 12 seconds, the IU’s computer used
stored roll and pitch commands to activate the gimbaled engines,
thereby rolling the huge rocket to a proper flight azimuth and, at
the same time, pitching it to the prescribed angle of attack for the
first-stage boost. When the IU received a signal that the propellant
level in the S-IC fuel tank had reached a specified point, it
initiated commands for first-stage engine cutoff, followed by stage
separation. Soon after the start of second-stage (S-II) ignition, the
vehicle was controlled by a concept called “path adaptive guidance,”
which put the rocket on a trajectory that would use the propellants
efficiently. About once every two seconds, the computer checked the
vehicle’s current position and flight conditions, comparing it with
the optimum situation desired at the end of powered flight (altitude,
velocity, residual propellants, etc.). As required, the IU generated
correction signals from the computer through the data adapter to the
analog flight control computer, which then issued appropriate gimbal
commands to the engines. Engine cutoff and stage separation of the
S-II from the S-IVB occurred when the IU sensed predetermined
propellant levels. Because the vehicle had reached its approximate
orbital altitude by this time, the S-IVB ignition and burn were
fairly short—just enough time to ensure altitude and speed for a
secure parking orbit.<a href="notes.htm#n8.43">[43]</a></p>
<p>If it became necessary to abort the mission,
each Saturn carried a propellant dispersion system (PDS). This
euphemism referred to a destruct mechanism to terminate the flight of
any stage of the vehicle after the astronaut crew had separated from
the rocket. The PDS system complied with regulations established by
the officials of the Air Force Eastern Test Range and was under the
control of the range safety officer, who could end the flight if the
vehicle wandered beyond the prescribed limits of the flight path or
otherwise became a safety hazard. A radio frequency unit received,
decoded, and controlled the PDS commands, and an ordnance train
demolished the stage or stages by rupturing the propellant tanks. The
ordnance train included initiator assemblies and flexible
linear-shaped charges situated in strategic locations to rip open the
tanks after engine cutoff, spilling the propellants in a pattern to
minimize their mixing during the process.<a href="notes.htm#n8.44">[44]</a></p>
<p>The Saturn rockets had other special ordnance
requirements for stage separation and the use of retrorockets to
ensure that the forward inertia of the lower stage after separation
did not carry it into the stage <span class="page" id="p256"> </span> ahead. The IU
contained the program for arming and firing the ordnance systems both
for stage separation and for triggering the retrorockets. The timing
of the stage separation sequence was keyed to the rated thrust of
each stage, which began to fall off as the propellants reached
depletion. The stages were separated when an explosive device around
the circumference of the vehicle severed a tension strap, thereby
allowing the appropriate stage separation sequence to take place. As
the retrorockets quickly pushed the spent stage backward, the next
live stage continued in a short coasting trajectory to make sure
adequate distance separated it from its predecessor and to resettle
the propellants before engine ignition.<a href="notes.htm#n8.45">[45]</a> To decelerate spent stages and settle the propellants
in each of the succeeding live stages, MSFC designers used a variety
of rocket systems, including small solid-propellant motors and small
liquid-propellant engines. The various models of the Saturn launch
vehicle family actually carried more solid-propellant systems than
liquid-propellant rocket engines: the Saturn I mounted 32
solid-propellant motors of various types; the Saturn IB mounted 31;
and the Saturn V carried 22.<a href="notes.htm#n8.46">[46]</a></p>
<p>The Earth-orbital sequence of the S-IVB
permitted the IU to compute reignition times continuously and take
updated data from ground stations. With only one main engine for
direct thrust control, the IU managed S-IVB roll, pitch, and yaw
through its liquid propellant auxiliary propulsion system (APS).
After final checks, the IU controlled the vehicle’s entry into the
translunar trajectory. A pair of jettisonable solid retrorockets and
the APS together provided ullage control, followed by main-stage
firing of the J-2 and engine cutoff when the IU reported that
acceptable injection conditions had been achieved. Finally, when the
spacecraft and lunar module disengaged from the S-IVB and IU, the IU
and the third stage’s APS units provided attitude stabilization for
the transposition and docking maneuver. About 6.5 hours from liftoff,
the tasks of the IU were finished.<a href="notes.htm#n8.47">[47]</a></p>
<h3>Summary: Checkout, Guidance, and Control</h3>
<p>Development of checkout systems and the
instrument unit reflected the same patterns as stage development.
Despite attempts to rely on existing systems and equipment, the size
and sophistication of the Saturn program required new development.
New computer languages such as ATOLL were introduced to solve
problems arising from the peculiarities of design, test, and several
different contractors, each of whom had been using different computer
languages. Automation of checkout and of static-firing tests of
Saturn stages was a notable accomplishment, even if some test
engineers were reluctant to surrender control to new, electronic
masters.</p>
<p><span class="page" id="p257"> </span> The instrument
unit, using many theories and design features that originated in the
wartime V-2 program in Germany, is an interesting example of
technology transfer. Of course, the Saturn program itself generated
several advanced ideas. The need to reduce weight stimulated new
research into the use of beryllium and lithium-magnesium alloys;
reliability and operational requirements stimulated new research in
microminiature circuitry such as the triple modular
redundancy.</p>
<p>Obviously, each contractor had a
responsibility for managing its own respective engine, stage, or
instrument unit. Overall management and coordination of these various
elements was NASA’s responsibility, a job carried out by the Marshall
Space Flight Center, which also supervised the delivery of the
Saturn’s various parts to test sites and to Cape Kennedy for
launch.</p>
