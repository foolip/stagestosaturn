<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p><span class="page" id="xi"> </span> Few of man’s
technological endeavors compare in scope of significance to the
development of the Saturn family of launch vehicles.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing in 1979, we may
still be too close to the project to see it objectively from the
perspective of history, but I expect that future historians will
compare the development of Saturn to such great and imaginative
projects as the building of the Panama Canal and to such latter-day
technological achievements as the Manhattan Project. In terms of both
vision and achievement, Saturn may surpass them all.</p>
<p>It was as if the Wright Brothers had gone from
building their original Wright Flyer in 1903 to developing a
supersonic Concorde in 1913. Unimaginable; yet in 10 short years the
builders of Saturn progressed from the small, single-engine rockets
like Redstone to the giant vehicle with clustered engines that put
man on the moon. Our Earth-to-orbit weight-lifting capability grew in
that decade by 10 thousand times. </p>
<p>Saturn was an engineering masterpiece. The
ultimate Saturn, taller than the Statue of Liberty, had a takeoff
weight that exceeded that of 25 fully loaded jet airliners, and
produced as much power as 85 Hoover Dams.</p>
<p>The Saturn program was also a masterpiece of
management. There are those who hold that one of the principal
benefits this country derived from the Apollo-Saturn lunar landing
program was the development of a new and extraordinary management
approach through which the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration directed vast human and material resources toward a
common purpose. The system that was developed to meet the incredible
complexities of the program, taking account of its pioneering nature
and the time constraint imposed, provides a pattern for managing a
broad spectrum of future technological, scientific, and social
endeavors. </p>
<p>One of the most remarkable things about the
Saturn program was its success rate. An early press release openly
stated that because of the <span class="page" id="xii"> </span> complexity of the
system and the tremendous advancement in technology required, program
officials fully expected half of the 10 Saturn I’s launched to fail.
None did. Neither did any Saturn IB, nor did any Saturn V, either
test vehicle or operational rocket—and there were 32 Saturn launches
in all.</p>
<p>The reliability assessment of the system was
such that only two Saturn Vs were launched before the third sent
Frank Borman’s crew around the moon during Christmas of 1968. In all,
27 men went around the moon aboard Saturn-launched space vehicles, 12
actually walked on its surface.</p>
<p>Close on the heels of the lunar landing
series, NASA developed Skylab, the world’s first major laboratory in
which we could operate experiments in the new environment of space.
The Saturn again played a pivotal role in this enterprise—the core
component of the Skylab itself being a modified Saturn stage. Only a
Saturn V could lift the huge laboratory into orbit, which, when an
Apollo spacecraft was annexed, weighed 100 metric tons and was 36
meters long. The three crews, which inhabited the space station for a
total time of nearly six months, were launched on the smaller Saturn
IBs. The Saturn family made Skylab possible, so Saturn deserves a
large share of the credit for the mission’s success in establishing a
broad foundation of scientific and technological knowledge.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should not overlook the role
Saturn played in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project of 1975. It was
another Saturn IB that carried an American crew to its historic
rendezvous with two Soviet cosmonauts in orbit. The reliable Saturn
gave NASA every confidence that its crew could ascend on schedule
following the Soviet launch half a world away and make the
time-critical union of those two small objects in space. We had a
high level of confidence that this, the last Saturn, would perform
with the same excellence as its 31 predecessors. It did not
disappoint us.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the
Apollo-Saturn program was a national achievement. It has been
estimated that 20 000 private firms and 300 000 people participated
in the development of this system. The challenge taxed American
ingenuity to the extreme. The result, of course, was that American
technology made the “giant leap” referred to by Neil Armstrong. Whole
new industries were born, offering products that touch our everyday
lives in ways we could not have dreamed of just a decade
before.</p>
<p>We may not soon again face a challenge to
match the lunar landing, and it may be some time before we mount the
kind of scientific and engineering effort that gave us Saturn.
Whenever that next challenge comes, we have in the Apollo-Saturn
program the basic blueprint for achieving success. It not only will
point the way but will also give the confidence needed to undertake
new and dramatic challenges.</p>
<p><span class="page" id="xiii"> </span> Among the other
lessons learned from the development of Saturn is the evidence of how
much a free society can do and how far a dedicated people can go when
they are properly challenged, led, motivated, and supported.
</p>
<p>This is our legacy from Saturn.</p>
