<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<ol>
<li id="n1.1">The name of the
locale, Cape Canaveral, was officially changed on 28 Nov. 1963 to
honor the late President John F. Kennedy, and the NASA facility was
henceforth called John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC).</li>
<li id="n1.2">The official NASA
history of Kennedy Space Center and the launch facilities and
concepts is by Charles D. Benson and William B. Faherty,
<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/cover.html"><i>Moonport:
A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations</i></a>,
NASA SP-4204 (Washington, 1978). Material for this
section was compiled from the following sources: KSC, <i>The Kennedy
Space Center Story</i> (Kennedy Space Center, Fla., 1969); NASA,
<i>Astronautics and Aeronautics, 1969: Chronology on Science, Technology,
and Policy</i>, NASA SP-4014 (Washington, 1970); MSFC, “Chronology of
MSFC—1969” (draft copy), (1972); NASA, <i>Saturn V News Reference</i>
(1968); MSFC, <i>Saturn V Flight Manual, SA-506</i> (1969).</li>
<li id="n1.3">MSFC, <i>Saturn V Flight
Manual, SA-506</i>, passim; MSFC, <i>Chronology of MSFC—1969</i>, passim; NASA,
<i>Saturn V News Reference</i>, passim.</li>
<li id="n1.4">There are many books
covering this period. For a readable and authoritative summary, see
the well-illustrated historical survey by Wernher von Braun and
Frederick I. Ordway, <i>History of Rocketry and Space Travel</i> (New York,
1969), pp. 22–40, which also includes an excellent bibliography. See
also Eugene M. Emme, <i>A History of Space Flight</i> (New York, 1965),
passim., which includes a bibliography. For the lifesaving rocket,
see Mitchell R. Sharpe, <i>Development of the Lifesaving Rocket</i>,
Marshall Space Flight Center, Historical Note no. 4, 10 June 1969.
The bibliographical study by Katherine Murphy Dickson, <i>History of
Aeronautics and Astronautics: A Preliminary Bibliography</i>, NASA HHR-29
(Washington, 1968), features annotated entries, and lists many
government documents, as well as articles from scholarly journals and
periodicals of both European and American origin.</li>
<li id="n1.5">For an overview of
this era and its leading personalities, see the histories by Loyd S.
Swenson, Jr., James M. Grimwood, and Charles C. Alexander,
<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/toc.htm"><i>This
New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury</i></a>,
NASA SP-4201 (Washington, 1966); von Braun and
Ordway, <i>History</i>; and Emme, <i>History</i>. Tsiolkovsky’s collected papers
are available in translation as NASA Technical Translations F-243,
326, 327 and 328 (1965). For an authorized biography of Goddard see
Milton Lehman, <i>This High Man: The Life of Robert H. Goddard</i> (New
York, 1963); but see also Esther Goddard and G. Edward Pendray, eds.,
<i>The Papers of Robert H. Goddard</i> (New York, 1970), 3 vols. Willy Ley,
<i>Rockets, Missiles, and Men in Space</i> (New York, 1968) includes
considerable historical information. Ley not only knew Oberth and
other pioneering figures of the twenties and thirties, he also
participated in many experimental projects. Frederick C. Durant, III,
and George S.James, eds., <i>First Steps Toward Space</i>, Smithsonian
Annals of Flight, no. 10 (Washington, 1974), includes a memoir by
Oberth, as well as contributions concerning Goddard and the
Smithsonian, and essays on rocket research in Europe and the U.S. in
the twenties and thirties. Eugene M. Emme, ed., <i>The History of Rocket
Technology: Essays on Research Development and Utility</i> (Detroit,
1964), includes summary essays on U.S. rocket technology in the
pre-World War II years.</li>
<li id="n1.6">See, for example, von
Braun and Ordway, <i>History</i>; Emme, <i>History of Space Travel</i>; and
Swenson, Grimwood, and Alexander,
<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/toc.htm"><i>This
New Ocean</i></a>. Wartime Russian rocketry is
analyzed in Coleman Goldberg, <i>An Introduction to Russian Rocketry:
History, Development, and Prospects</i>, Off. of the Asst. Chief of
Staff, Intelligence. U.S. Army Field Detachment R, 1 June 1959. Copy
in JSC files.</li>
<li id="n1.7">Ernst Stuhlinger, et
al., eds., <i>Astronautical Engineering and Science: From Peenemuende to
Planetary Space</i> (New York, 1963), pp. 366–367; von Braun and Ordway,
<i>History</i>, pp. 63–74.</li>
<li id="n1.8">Dornberger summarizes
the V-2 work in Emme, <i>Rocket Technology</i>, pp. 29–45, and has published
his own memoir, entitled <i>V-2</i> (New York, 1954). This book is one of
the most authoritative works on the V-2 and Peenemuende generally
available, in addition to Dieter K. Huzel, <i>Peenemuende to Canaveral</i>
(Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1962); and Krafft A. Ehricke, “The
Peenemuende Rocket Center, Part 2,” <i>Rocketscience</i>, 4 (June 1950): 35.
See also, Mitchell Sharpe, “Evolution of Rocket Technology:
Historical Note, Saturn History Project,” Jan. 1974, pp. 15–20 (copy
in SHP files); von Braun and Ordway, <i>History</i>, 104–117. Practically
every aspect of the V-2, from basic research to its early design and
testing to its deployment, can be found in a large collection of
technical reports from Peenemuende, located in the Redstone
Scientific Information Center, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone
Arsenal, Ala.</li>
<li id="n1.9">Von Braun and Ordway,
<i>History</i>, pp. 114–117; Dornberger, <i>V-2</i>, passim. Plans for rounding up
German scientific and technical personnel were in progress by early
1945. During the spring, the idea was known as Operation Overcast. In
1946, the program was renamed Operation Paperclip, the designation
which became the most familiar. See Clarence Lasby, <i>Operation
Paperclip</i> (New York, 1971).</li>
<li id="n1.10">Von Braun and
Ordway, <i>History</i>, p. 18; Sharpe, “Evolution,” pp. 42–48. Between May
1945 and Dec. 1952, the U.S. recruited 642 foreign technicians and
specialists under Paperclip. Lasby, <i>Operation Paperclip</i>, gives the
absorbing details of their utilization by the Air Force, Army, and
Navy. Generally, most of the specialists served individually or in
very small, close-knit groups. The von Braun team of 132 was by far
the largest single group.</li>
<li id="n1.11">For an overview of
the early postwar era, see von Braun and Ordway, <i>History</i>, pp.
120–139; Swenson, Grimwood, and Alexander,
<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/toc.htm"><i>This
New Ocean</i></a>, pp. 18–31. More specific

stages, and NASA management concurred. The development of the S-V

during S-IV/IVB development, commented that the availability of
significant amounts of helium in this country constituted a special

be easy to dismiss such sloganeering, but it was very pervasive and
seems to have been taken very seriously. During a tour of contractor
facilities in the Los Angeles area in 1971, the author could not help
but notice the prominently displayed stickers and placards in
engineers’ drafting rooms, shop areas, and offices, and the huge
banners, proclaiming PRIDE, VIP, etc., hung across the walls of the
cavernous buildings where the Saturn V stages were assembled. In
cafeterias, and even in executive conference rooms, the coasters for
coffee cups and water glasses carried appropriate slogans for “Manned
Flight Awareness.” For further details of the Manned Flight Awareness

<p style="margin: 0; text-indent: 2em">Each Saturn I flight, SA-1 through SA-10, was
preceded by a technical summary including miscellaneous diagrams,
mission profile details, and operational highlights. See, for
example, MSFC, <i>Technical Information Summary, SA-1</i>, and subsequent.
In addition, each of the Saturn I missions received an exhaustive
postmission analysis, best summarized by the “Saturn Flight
Evaluation Working Group,” which operated out of the Flight
Evaluation and Operational Studies Div., Aero-Astrodynamics Lab. See,
for example, MSFC, Saturn Flight Evaluation Working Group, <i>Saturn
AS-1 Flight Evaluation</i>, a generic title, respectively, for the SA-1,
SA-2, and SA-3 missions. For missions SA-4 through SA-10, see MSFC,
Saturn Flight Evaluation Working Group, <i>Results of the Fourth Saturn
I Launch Vehicle Test Flight</i>, SA-4, and subsequent. All of these
documents may be consulted in the files of the MSFC Historical Off.
All launches made from Cape Kennedy (or Cape Canaveral, as it was
known prior to 1963) are conveniently tabulated and summarized in
William A. Lockyer, Jr., ed., <i>A Summary of Major NASA Launchings,
Eastern Test Range and Western Test Range: October 1, 1958 to
September 30, 1970</i>, rev. ed., Historical Report no. 1 (Kennedy Space

general as well as specific information on the Saturn I series.
Mission highlights of each Saturn I launch are recapitulated in MSFC,

Skepticism about the Saturn I launches, and Highwater in particular,
was expressed to me by NASA employees at Huntsville and elsewhere.
The persistence of such allegations prompted me to question several
Saturn I project managers; they tended to reaffirm the presumed value
of Highwater and later Block II launches in particular. Von Braun’s
response seemed to be the most candid. See von Braun interview, NASA,
30 Nov. 1971.</li>

authoritative single volume on Soviet launch vehicles and other
Soviet space technology is Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space
Sciences, <i>Soviet Space Programs, 1966–1970</i>, staff report, 92nd Cong.,
1st sess., 9 Dec. 1971. This document includes a general discussion
of the standard launch vehicle series, known as the A version, p. 135
ff. The discussion is preceded by a highly useful table of the
characteristics of Soviet launch vehicles, on pp. 133–134.
Illustrations are included on pp. 560–561, 563, 572–573. See also,
Peter L. Smolders, <i>Soviets in Space</i> (New York: Taplinger Publishing
Co., 1974). This book is translated from the Dutch edition which
appeared in 1971. The author used no footnotes, but apparently he had
access to an unusually large amount of unpublished information, and
had opportunities for interviews with a number of leading Russian
cosmonauts and scientists. A good, brief discussion of Soviet rockets
appears on pp. 59–69, a useful illustration on p. 64, and a numbered,
cut-away diagram of the Salyut vehicle on pp. 70–71. A recent survey
of rocket technology, including the Russian vehicles, is Kenneth
Gatland, <i>Missiles and Rockets</i> (New York: Macmillan Co., 1975), pp.
184–199 especially. This discussion includes comments on some of the
later engines and on the range of Soviet rockets, as well as
photographs of the engines themselves. Useful and detailed
illustrations, done by a professional illustrator team, appear on pp.
76–82. These include a very useful illustration of the RD-107 engine
(p. 77) as well as a launch profile of a Soyuz mission (p. 81). A
noted expert and writer on space technology, Gatland is editor of the
authoritative British magazine, <i>Spaceflight</i>. See also Nicholas
Daniloff, <i>The Kremlin and the Cosmos</i> (New York: Alfred A. Knopf,
1972); and Leonid Vladimirov, <i>The Russian Space Bluff</i> (New York: Dial
Press, 1973). The latter was written by a former mechanical engineer
and scientific editor from the Soviet Union, who decided to defect in
1966. His intriguing thesis is that the Russians remained one step
ahead of the U.S. during the 1960s because they felt that American
space programs were further ahead than they actually were, and the
Russians undertook a series of very risky space shots to maintain
their propaganda advantage. The publisher included a comment by von
Braun that the book was “fascinating, informative and worthy of a
wide readership in the United States” (cited opposite the book’s
title page).</li>

was sited near an existing metropolis (Houston) of considerable size.
KSC, in Brevard County, Fla., was located in an area of several
smaller communities. MSFC, near Huntsville, was established near a
medium-sized, though well-established, city. MAF occupied existing
facilities within the New Orleans metropolitan area, whereas MTF was
largely a huge buffer zone for testing, different in concept from all
of the above, employing a smaller number of permanent civil service
and contractor personnel. Thus, the subtleties of NASA impact were
different in each case, despite general patterns in terms of jobs,
construction, and so on. See also Raymond A. Bauer, <i>Second-Order
Consequences: A Methodological Essay on the Impact of Technology</i>
