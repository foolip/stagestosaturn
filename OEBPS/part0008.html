      <p> The overall success of the Saturn program depended on a significant number of key decisions. One of these would have to be the decision in 1957 to start consideration of the clustered engine concept as a means to get heavy payloads into orbit. As natural as this concept seems today, it has to be remembered that the tricky nature and recalcitrant operating characteristics of rocket engines at that time suggested clustering of two or more engines would be courting absolute disaster. Next was the decision to use liquid hydrogen as one of the propellants. The application of this high-energy fuel made all the difference in the performance of the Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V vehicles. The use of the fuel allowed optimum sizing of the stages while keeping the weight to a minimum, so that a three-astronaut payload could be carried successfully into orbit and boosted into lunar trajectory. The controversy of EOR-LOR also stands out as a major period of decision early in the program. The choice of LOR led to the successful Saturn IB interim vehicle and stabilized the design configuration of the Saturn V. Finally, the decision to adopt the all-up concept stands out as one of the steps that permitted the United States to achieve the manned lunar landing on the moon before the end of the 1960s.</p>
      <p> It is interesting to note that the von Braun team argued about the acceptance of three of these four major program milestones. On the other hand, the argument seems to have been one of degree rather than one of substance. Despite the strong recollections of individuals who say that von Braun opposed liquid hydrogen from the beginning, one must remember that LH 2  had been included very early by MFSC—in terms of the Centaur upper stage—in some of the early Saturn system studies.</p>
      <p> The collective technological experience of the Saturn program was effectively applied in planning the Shuttle program, most notably in the Shuttle's propellant and propulsion systems. Marshall's experience in the handling and pumping of cryogenics, construction of fuel tanks, and development of the LH 2  engines were directly applied to the Shuttle concept. 29</p>
      <p> In one respect, the technology of the Saturn vehicle represented the closing of a circle in international space partnership and cooperation. Allies in World War II, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. both borrowed heavily from the technological storehouse of their defeated foe, Germany. In the early postwar years, both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. learned from firing their respective stocks of captured V-2 rockets and perfected significant sectors of their own new rocket technology out of the V-2 experience common to both. This propulsion technology was further elaborated during the Cold War era along an escalating front of improved ICBM weaponry. When landing on the moon became an acknowledged race,</p>

      <p> LEGACIES</p>
      <p> both borrowed liberally from the extant technology of ICBM propulsion systems to build large rocket boosters. Tempered in wars both hot and cold, the technological heritage of the launch vehicles that put the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project into orbit could be traced back to the German technicians of World War II. The former wartime allies were now closing a technological circle that had ranged from partners, to protagonists, to partners again, with German expertise in rocketry as a catalyst.</p>
      <p> Partnership in space, by itself, will be no automatic guarantee of international amity. Partnership in space exploration may be an exhilarating prospect, however, offering an additional incentive for international cooperation and peace. If so, then the Saturn program may count this factor as its most important legacy.</p>

      <p> Average R&amp;D Costs for One Saturn I, IB, and V Launch Vehicle</p>
      <p> Saturn I  The initial development and production of the Saturn I was accomplished in-house; only the latter stages were placed on contract. Army projects assumed the initial FY 1958 and 1959 costs; NASA's total costs were not accumulated, during the development phase, to provide a true average unit cost (i.e., the original plan for S-I stages was to procure 21 each). At the conclusion of the program shown on the funding history, the total cost to NASA of the 10 Saturn Is actually launched was $753 million.</p>
      <p> Saturn IB and Saturn V</p>
      <p> Costs for development and production of the Saturn IBs and Saturn Vs were not collected by specific vehicle because of the magnitude of the modifications based on mission requirements and because of the sustaining engineering and launch support required to support lengthened schedule restraints. The following unit costs include production of basic hardware plus modifications, spares, and associated ground support equipment for MSFC-responsible hardware only (first stage through instrument unit). Costs exclude all development, sustaining engineering, transportation, propellants, storage, etc., required to launch.</p>

      <p> Notes</p>
      <p> CHAPTER  1</p>
      <p> 1.   The name of the locale, Cape Canaveral, was officially changed on 28 Nov. 1963 to honor the late President John F. Kennedy, and the NASA facility was henceforth called John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC).</p>
      <p> 2.   The official NASA history of Kennedy Space Center and the launch facilities and concepts is by Charles D. Benson and William B. Faherty,  Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations,  NASA SP-4204 (Washington, 1978). Material for this section was compiled from the following sources: KSC,  The Kennedy Space Center Story  (Kennedy Space Center, Fla., 1969); NASA,  Astronautics and Aeronautics, 1969: Chronology on Science, Technology, and Policy,  NASA SP-4014 (Washington, 1970); MSFC, "Chronology of MSFC—1969" (draft copy), (1972); NASA, Saturn V News Reference  (1968); MSFC,  Saturn V Flight Manual, SA-506  (1969).</p>
      <p> 3.   MSFC,  Saturn V Flight Manual, SA-506,  passim; MSFC,  Chronology of MSFC—1969,  passim; NASA,  Saturn V News Reference,  passim.</p>
      <p> 4.   There are many books covering this period. For a readable and authoritative summary, see the well-illustrated historical survey by Wernher von Braun and Frederick I. Ordway,  History of Rocketry and Space Travel  (New York,  1969), pp. 22—40, which also includes an excellent bibliography. See also Eugene M. Emme,  A History of Space Flight  (New York, 1965), passim., which includes a bibliography. For the lifesaving rocket, see Mitchell R. Sharpe,  Development of the Lifesaving Rocket,  Marshall Space Flight Center, Historical Note no. 4, 10 June 1969. The bibliographical study by Katherine Murphy Dickson,  History of Aeronautics and Astronautics: A Preliminary Bibliography,  NASA HHR-29 (Washington, 1968), features annotated entries, and lists many government documents, as well as articles from scholarly journals and periodicals of both European and American origin.</p>
      <p> 5.  For an overview of this era and its leading personalities, see the histories by Loyd S. Swenson, Jr., James M. Grimwood, and Charles C. Alexander,  This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury, NASA SP-4201  (Washington,  1966); von Braun and Ordway,  History;  and Emme,  History. Tsiolkovsky's collected papers are available in translation as NASA Technical Translations F-243, 326, 327 and 328 (1965). For an authorized biography of Goddard see Milton Lehman, This High Man: The Life of Robert H. Goddard  (New York, 1963); but see also Esther Goddard and G. Edward Pendray, eds.,  The Papers of Robert H. Goddard  (New York, 1970), 3 vols. Willy Ley, Rockets, Missiles, and Men in Space  (New York, 1968) includes considerable historical information. Ley not only knew Oberth and other pioneering figures of the twenties and thirties, he also participated in many experimental projects. Frederick C. Durant, III, and George S.James, eds., First Steps Toward Space,  Smithsonian Annals of Flight, no. 10 (Washington, 1974), includes a memoir by Oberth, as well as contributions concerning Goddard and the Smithsonian, and essays on rocket research in Europe and the U.S. in the twenties and thirties. Eugene M. Emme,</p>

      <p> NOTES TO PAGES  11-19</p>
      <p> ed.,  The History of Rocket Technology: Essays on Research Development and Utility  (Detroit, 1964), includes summary essays on U.S. rocket technology in the pre-World War II years.</p>
      <p> 6.   See, for example, von Braun and Ordway,  History;  Emme,  History of Space Travel;  and Swenson, Grimwood, and Alexander,  This New Ocean.  Wartime Russian rocketry is analyzed in Coleman Goldberg,  An Introduction to Russian Rocketry: History, Development, and Prospects,  Off. of the Asst. Chief of Staff, Intelligence. U.S. Army Field Detachment R, 1 June 1959. Copy in JSC files.</p>
      <p> 7.   Ernst Stuhlinger, et al., eds.,  Astronautical Engineering and Science: From Peenemuende to Planetary Space  (New York, 1963), pp. 366-367; von Braun and Ordway,  History,  pp. 63-74.</p>
      <p> 8.   Dornberger summarizes the V-2 work in Emme,  Rocket Technology,  pp. 29—45, and has published his own memoir, entitled  V-2  (New York, 1954). This book is one of the most authoritative works on the V-2 and Peenemuende generally available, in addition to Dieter K. Huzel,  Peenemuende to Canaveral  (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1962); and Krafft A. Ehricke, "The Peenemuende Rocket Center, Part 2,"  Rocketscience,  4 (June 1950):35. See also, Mitchell Sharpe, "Evolution of Rocket Technology: Historical Note, Saturn History Project," Jan. 1974, pp. 15-20 (copy in SHP files); von Braun and Ordway,  History,  104—117. Practically every aspect of the V-2, from basic research to its early design and testing to its deployment, can be found in a large collection of technical reports from Peenemuende, located in the Redstone Scientific Information Center, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Ala.</p>
      <p> 9.   Von Braun and Ordway,  History,  pp. 114—117; Dornberger,  V-2,  passim. Plans for rounding up German scientific and technical personnel were in progress by early 1945. During the spring, the idea was known as Operation Overcast. In 1946, the program was renamed Operation Paperclip, the designation which became the most familiar. See Clarence Lasby,  Operation Paperclip  (New York, 1971).</p>
      <p> 10.   Von Braun and Ordway,  History,  p. 18; Sharpe, "Evolution," pp. 42-48. Between May 1945 and Dec. 1952, the U.S. recruited 642 foreign technicians and specialists under Paperclip. Lasby, Operation Paperclip,  gives the absorbing details of their utilization by the Air Force, Army, and Navy. Generally, most of the specialists served individually or in very small, close-knit groups. The von Braun team of 132 was by far the largest single group.</p>
      <p> 11.   For an overview of the early postwar era, see von Braun and Ordway,  History,  pp. 120-139; Swenson, Grimwood, and Alexander,  This New Ocean,  pp. 18-31. More specific studies include J. L. Chapman,  Atlas: The Story of a Missile  (New York, 1960); James Baar and William Howard, Polaris  (New York, 1960); and Julian Hartt,  Mighty Thor  (New York, 1961). See also Ernest G. Schwiebert, ed.,  A History of the U.S. Air Force Ballistic Missiles  (New York, 1965), and Michael Armacost,  Politics of Weapons Innovation: The Thor-Jupiter Controversy  (New York, 1969).</p>

      <p> 6.   Glennan memo, "Administrator's Statement." By the fall of 1960, Convair won the S-V contract, but the future of this third stage became marginal. In Jan. 1961, von Braun recommended a change in the C-l, from three to two stages, and  NASA management concurred. The development of the S-V subsequently was canceled.</p>

Evidently, there were questions about the significance of Chrysler's proposal to build its own plant near Cape Canaveral. This would have entailed government funds and equipment, the GAO noted. In any case, Chrysler's technical proposal received very low ratings. See, for example, Milton W. Rosen, "Technical Evaluation of Saturn S-IV Proposal; Comments On," memo, 8 June 1950.

      <p> 11.   The S-I first-stage booster for Saturn I made 10 launches, including 5 with a live S-IV stage. The S-IVB third stage made 5 launches with the Saturn IB, and 6 more on the Saturn V through the first lunar landing (AS-506). By the time of the final Apollo-Saturn mission (AS-512), the S-IVB notched 6 more launches for a total of 17 flights. The first two stages of the Saturn V, the S-IC and the S-II, had an even dozen launches on Apollo missions. The S-IC/S-II combination also launched the Skylab orbital workshop. The last 4 Saturn IB/S-IVB launches involved three Skylab crews and the ASTP crew, for a grand total of 21 S-IVB flights.</p>

      <p> 44.   Ibid., 5.6-5.7. As a back-up concept, the S-IVB carried seven extra ambient helium spheres on the thrust structure. Two provided redundancy for LOX tank pressurization, and five provided redundancy for the LH 2  tank (ibid.). O. S. Tyson, one of MSFC's resident managers at Douglas during S-IV/IVB development, commented that the availability of significant amounts of helium in this country constituted a special advantage in the U.S space program, since the efficient helium system permitted lower design weights and plumbing for stage pressure systems and other functions.

Loss of S-IVB-503 led to substitution of stage serial numbers 504 for 503N, 505 for 504N, and 506 for 505N. The availability of excess 507 tankage led to its reincarnation as S-IVB-506, with S-IVB-507 and subsequent stages produced as originally planned (Akens,  Saturn Chronology,  pp. 161-162).</p>

Other means of guidance include (1) command guidance: data sent to the vehicle from an operator or computer; (2) homing: may home in on natural radiation or from infrared wavelengths emanating from the target; (3) beam riding: vehicle steers itself along the axis of radar or other system pointed at the target.</p>
      <p> Draper was a leading researcher in the field of guidance and control, and his book is a basic treatise in the literature. For a survey of the state of the art during the period of the Saturn program, see Frederick I. Ordway III, James Patrick Gardner, and Mitchell R. Sharpe,  Basic Astronautics  (Englewood Cliffs, N.

      <p> 50.   Mitchell R. Sharpe interview, 6 Aug. 1973. It would be easy to dismiss such sloganeering, but it was very pervasive and seems to have been taken very seriously. During a tour of contractor facilities in the Los Angeles area in 1971, the author could not help but notice the prominently displayed stickers and placards in engineers' drafting rooms, shop areas, and offices, and the huge banners, proclaiming PRIDE, VIP, etc., hung across the walls of the cavernous buildings where the Saturn V stages were assembled. In cafeterias, and even in executive conference rooms, the coasters for coffee cups and water glasses carried appropriate slogans for "Manned Flight Awareness."

      <p> Each Saturn I flight, SA-1 through SA-10, was preceded by a technical summary including miscellaneous diagrams, mission profile details, and operational highlights. See, for example, MSFC,  Technical Information Summary, SA-1,  and subsequent. In addition, each of the Saturn I missions received an exhaustive postmission analysis, best summarized by the "Saturn Flight Evaluation Working Group," which operated out of the Flight Evaluation and Operational Studies Div., Aero-Astrodynamics Lab. See, for example, MSFC, Saturn Flight Evaluation Working Group,  Saturn AS-1 Flight Evaluation,  a generic title, respectively, for the SA-1, SA-2, and SA-3 missions. For missions SA-4 through SA-10, see MSFC, Saturn Flight Evaluation Working Group,  Results of the Fourth Saturn I Launch Vehicle Test Flight,  SA-4, and subsequent. All of these documents may be consulted in the files of the MSFC Historical Off. All launches made from Cape Kennedy (or Cape Canaveral, as it was known prior to 1963) are conveniently tabulated and summarized in William A. Lockyer, Jr., ed.,  A Summary of Major NASA Launchings, Eastern Test Range and Western Test Range: October 1,1958 to September 30, 1970,  rev. ed., Historical Report no. 1 (Kennedy Space Center, Fla., 1970). Files of the Saturn History Project include general as well as specific information on the Saturn I series. Mission highlights of each Saturn I launch are recapitulated in MSFC,  Saturn I Summary,  15 Feb. 1966. See also B. E. Duran, "Saturn ' I/IB Launch Vehicle Operational Status and Experience," Society of Automotive Engineers, Paper no. 680739, 1968. James P. Lindberg, "Saturn I Flight Test Evaluation," MSFC, 1966, includes mission summaries and technical diagrams. Propulsion aspects are treated more specifically in B. K. Heusinger, "Saturn Propulsion Improvements,"  Astronautics and Aeronautics, 2 (Aug. 1964): 20-25. For information more specifically related to the Block I vehicles, see O. Hoberg, "Saturn SA-1 Flight and Its Instrumentation," MSFC, Apr. 1966; F. A. Speer, "Saturn I Flight Test Evaluation," AIAA Paper 64-322, July 1964; Fernando S. Garcia,  An Aerodynamic Analysis of Saturn I Block I Flight Test Vehicles,  MSFC: NASA TND-20002, Feb. 1964. Unless otherwise noted, information for the composite summaries of the Saturn missions was abstracted from the documents noted above.</p>

The problem of meteoroid penetration of booster tank walls, as well as spacecraft, was also noted in interviews with von Braun, NASA, 30 Nov.   1971; Stuhlinger, MSFC, 25 Aug. 1971; Bucher, MSFC, 30 Aug. 1971. Stuhlinger had been chief of MSFC's Space Science Lab; Bucher was a top aide during the Pegasus project. For discussion of meteoroid research, see also "Satellites: Manned and Unmanned, Report of Conference at Virginia Polytechnic Institute,"  Science,  22 Nov. 1963, p. 1091; Joseph H. Wujek, "Experiments in Space,"  Electronics World,  July 1965, p. 48. Although many scientific books and journals refer to "micrometeoroids," NASA consistently used the term "meteoroid," with diminutive size inherently implied. The author has followed NASA's style in this case.</p>
