<h1>I. Prologue</h1>
<p><span class="page" id="p1"> </span> The passage of time
blurs many details. Part One is intended to bring back into focus
some of the facts, circumstances, and background of space
exploration. The opening section of chapter 1 briefly recapitulates
the flight of <i>Apollo 11</i>—the first lunar landing mission—and provides
the opportunity to introduce some of the hardware and nomenclature of
the Apollo-Saturn program. A historical overview of rocketry,
including the main threads of Saturn’s origins, provides a background
for the scope and boldness of <i>Apollo 11</i> and the Saturn adventure in
the chapters that follow.</p>
