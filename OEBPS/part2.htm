<h1>II. The Saturn Building Blocks</h1>
<p><span class="page" id="p23"> </span> The original impetus
for Saturn envisioned a brawny booster to launch Department of
Defense payloads. The von Braun team at the Army Ballistic Missile
Agency (ABMA) received money from the Department of Defense’s
Advanced Research Projects Agency to demonstrate the concept.
Furthermore, von Braun’s group eventually became the nucleus of
NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). These convolutions and
the vague outlines of evolving Saturn vehicle technology constitute
the themes of <a href="ch2.htm">chapter
2</a>.</p>
<p>The Saturn program eventually included three
basic vehicles: Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V. <a href="ch3.htm">Chapter 3</a> describes the events that led to these three separate
rockets, whose configuration evolved out of the choice to go the moon
by means of the lunar orbit rendezvous technique. MSFC began
development of facilities to develop and test the mammoth boosters.
<a href="ch3.htm">Chapter
3</a> concludes with a discussion of the
design and manufacture of lower-stage boosters for the Saturn I and
Saturn IB.</p>
