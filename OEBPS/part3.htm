<h1>III. Fire, Smoke, and Thunder: The Engines</h1>
<p><span class="page" id="p87"> </span> The H-1 engine
traced its ancestry to postwar American development of rocket
propulsion systems, and the opening section of <a href="ch4.htm">chapter 4</a> includes an assessment of this engine’s technological
heritage. While the development of other engines discussed in Part
Three differed in specifics, the overall trends in their design,
test, and achievement of operational status paralleled that of the
H-1 and sprang from the same evolving technology. Introduced on the
Saturn V, the giant F-1 engine, while more akin to the conventional
cryogenics of the H-1, experienced many development problems. The
problem of scale affected many aspects of Saturn hardware
development, as the F-1 story attests.</p>
<p>Application of liquid hydrogen
(LH₂) technology constituted one of the key aspects of
Apollo-Saturn’s success. The upper stages of the Saturn I and Saturn
IB introduced LH₂-fueled RL-10 and J-2 engines, respectively, as
discussed in <a href="ch5.htm">chapter
5</a>.</p>
