<h1>IV. Building the Saturn V</h1>
<p><span class="page" id="p155"> </span> It might seem
logical to narrate the story of Saturn Vâ€™s various stages from the
bottom up, beginning with the S-IC stage. However, the stages were
not built that way. The Saturn V third stage, the S-IVB, evolved
first, based on upper stages of the Saturn I and Saturn IB. As the
first large unitary Saturn tankage (not a cluster of individual
tanks), a rather detailed discussion in <a href="ch7.htm">chapter 7</a> of some of the procedures used in S-IV-IVB fabrication
and manufacture eliminates repetitious discussion of similar
procedures for other stages in succeeding chapters.</p>
<p>The S-IC and S-II stages, while sharing a
common diameter, used different propellants. Although S-II contracts
were let prior to those of the S-IC, the S-II became the pacing item
in the Saturn program, completing its firing tests later than the
other components. <a href="ch8.htm">Chapter 8</a> explores S-IC and S-II commonalities and contrasts,
emphasizing the imbroglio of the S-II program and its eventual
recovery.</p>
<p>Computer technology played a consistent role
in the evolution of the Saturn vehicles. <a href="ch9.htm">Chapter 9</a> surveys computer activity from manufacturing, through
stage test, to launch. In flight, the computers of the instrument
unit guided and controlled the Saturn V, including the fiery
separation of Saturn V stages during their journey into space.
