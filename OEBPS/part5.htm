<h1>V. Coordination: Men and Machines</h1>
<p><span class="page" id="p259"> </span> Management of the
multifarious elements of the Saturn program entailed new tasks and
concepts beyond the scope of any previous rocket program. As
explained in chapter 9, MSFCâ€™s management was a dynamic process.
Although rooted in the experience of the von Braun team, dating back
to the 1930s, Saturn management responded to internal stimuli as well
as external influences, including the prime contractors, NASA
Headquarters, and other sources.</p>
<p>Almost last, but far from least, the challenge
of transporting rocket stages of exceptional size to test and launch
sites posed equally unique complications. Logistics became a special
management task. <a href="ch10.htm">Chapter 10</a> explores some of the ramifications of moving the
Saturn stages from points as far away as the Pacific coast to the
launch pad at Cape Kennedy, with intermediate stops for static-firing
tests and other checks.</p>
