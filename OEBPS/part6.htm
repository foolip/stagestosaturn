<h1>VI. Step by Step</h1>
<p><span class="page" id="p321"> </span> Few events are as
spectacular as that of a Saturn V at liftoff en route to the moon. In
fact, the commanding role of the mammoth vehicle has tended to
obscure its supporting players, the Saturn I and Saturn IB boosters.
Chapter 11 recapitulates some of the milestones of these earlier
rockets and describes some of the payloads and visual instrumentation
used in early launches to acquire crucial information about the
near-Earth environment and the behavior of exotic propellants in the
weightlessness of space.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest gamble of the
Apollo-Saturn program rode on the launch of AS-501, the first Saturn
V to lift off from Cape Kennedy. The decision to go “all up” on this
launch circumvented the costly and time-consuming process of
incremental flight testing of each stage prior to launching a
complete vehicle. This mission, followed by troubleshooting the
problems of AS-502, the first manned Saturn V launch (AS-503), and
the first lunar landing mission (AS-506, or Apollo 11), constitute
the highlights of <a href="ch12.htm">chapter 12</a>.</p>
