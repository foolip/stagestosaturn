<h1>VII. Epilogue</h1>
<p><span class="page" id="p379"> </span> Both the Soviets
and the Americans used their man-rated space rockets for a variety of
missions. NASA used basic Saturn hardware for launching the Skylab
space station; Skylab itself evolved from the Saturn V third stage.
The last Saturn rocket to be launched culminated in the linkup of a
manned American spacecraft with its manned Soviet counterpart—the
Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.</p>
<p>Thus, one of the legacies of what started as a
race in space ended in a new arena of international cooperation. The
Saturn program left other legacies. The city of Huntsville, Alabama,
entered a new era of social and economic vigor, since Marshall Space
Flight Center’s activities attracted nonspace commercial enterprises
to a booming locale and injected vitality into health care,
education, municipal services, and the arts. Finally, execution of
the Saturn program stimulated significant research and improved
technique across a wide range of fabrication and manufacturing
processes.</p>
