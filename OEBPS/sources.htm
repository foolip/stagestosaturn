<h1>Sources and Research Materials</h1>
<h3>Documentary Sources</h3>
<p>This history rests primarily on documents
acquired for the Saturn history project, under a contract awarded to
the University of Alabama in Huntsville by MSFC in 1968. Documents in
the Saturn history project (SHP) amount to approximately 24 file
drawers and are currently housed in the library of the University of
Alabama in Huntsville. Although the SHP files contain letters,
memoranda, and other documents copied from the History Office at NASA
Headquarters, as well as some material from the Kennedy and Johnson
Presidential Libraries, their principal strength is represented in
other aspects. The SHP files are primarily a collection of MSFC
documents and materials gathered from contractors involved in the
Saturn program. These documents include many unpublished reports and
summaries prepared for miscellaneous briefings and professional
meetings. Where no official control number was included, the source
has been identified as NASA Report, Douglas Report, etc.</p>
<p>Many engineers who were involved in the Saturn
program read papers at professional meetings of the American
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and many were reprinted
and cited herein as AIAA Paper No. 0000, etc. These AIAA papers were
very valuable in coming to grips with many key areas in Saturn
development, in discussing problems encountered, in trouble-shooting,
and in assessing the solutions adopted. For the most part, these
papers are notably candid and, because their authors were directly
associated with Saturn hardware, can be regarded as useful primary
sources. The SHP files also include selected correspondence, test
reports, flight summaries, press kits, and other miscellaneous
documents from NASA and contractor sources.</p>
<p>Although the files themselves are arranged in
chronological order, there is an extensive and detailed index
arranged by subject. The index is fully cross-referenced and
annotated. Additional documents, acquired during later phases of the
Saturn history, are housed with the SHP files, although they still
await indexing and location within the original files.</p>
<p>Finally, the SHP files include tapes,
transcripts, and notes of 128 interviews with NASA and contractor
personnel who worked on the Saturn rockets. Unhappily, some of the
interviews were recorded on tapes of inferior quality and the
transcriptions are only marginal or fragmentary. A number of other
transcriptions, although prepared from audible tapes, were so poorly
transcribed as to be unusable. Notes were taken of several interviews
when use of recording equipment was either impractical or impossible.
Other interviews, housed in the files of Johnson Space Center or at
NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., are so identified in the
backnotes.</p>
<p>In identifying authorship or affiliation with
government agencies and contractors, the following abbreviations have
been used:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>NASA</td>
<td>(National Aeronautics and Space Administration)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MSFC</td>
<td>(Marshall Space Flight Center)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>KSC</td>
<td>(Kennedy Space Center)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JSC</td>
<td>(Johnson Space Center)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MDAC</td>
<td>(McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NAR</td>
<td>(North American Rockwell)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In citing interviews, these abbreviations have
also been used to indicate the affiliation of the person who gave the
interview. “NASA” in the interviews identifies individuals primarily
associated with NASA Headquarters in Washington. Although von Braun
was interviewed while he was attached to NASA Headquarters (as Deputy
Associate Administrator for Planning) following his departure from
MSFC in March 1970, I have identified him as an affiliate of MSFC
because of his close association with Marshall and the Saturn
program.</p>
<p>Several other documentary sources were used in
writing the Saturn history. The files of the Historical Office,
Marshall Space Flight Center, although including miscellaneous
correspondence, were strongest in the series of monthly, quarterly,
and annual progress reports of major laboratories and individual MSFC
programs. These files were especially useful in establishing
chronological sequences and specific dates. Other files consulted are
now in MSFC’s Records Holding Area. These include the Director’s
Reading Files (1960–1969); Office of the Director, “Weekly Notes”
(1960–1968); Industrial Operations, Director’s Reading Files
(1960–1970); Industrial Operations, Record Files (1960–1970). I was
unable, apparently because of internal bureaucratic inertia, to gain
access to these files until a late phase of research. Fortunately, I
do not seem to have missed much. The files were disappointingly thin
in any matter of substance and dealt mostly with day-to-day
managerial and budgetary issues. The “Weekly Notes” were an
exception, including several folders on special projects, as well as
the weekly summaries from program managers and lab chiefs to von
Braun, all with his rejoinders, queries, and directions scribbled in
the margins.</p>
<p>Aside from the SHP files, the most rewarding
source of correspondence and memos came from the historical files at
NASA Headquarters, and from the files at Johnson Space Center. The
latter included a wide range of direct correspondence among
Headquarters, MSFC, and JSC. Because much correspondence from NASA
Headquarters to JSC included information relevant to the
Apollo-Saturn program as it involved other centers, the JSC files
contained a remarkable amount of material pertinent to the
Saturn.</p>
<p>The historian who delves into any of these
files and expects to find signed, original documents is going to be
disappointed. They must exist somewhere, but I did not see them.
Apollo-Saturn not only flourished in the “age of the copier,” it was
one of its chief customers. For all practical purposes, there is
nothing wrong with a copy, but the inability to find and actually
handle the original takes some of the zest from historical research.
The telephone is another obvious stumbling block in modern research.
NASA and contractor personnel alike emphasized their reliance on the
telephone to resolve problems and formulate policy on an ad hoc
basis, making many decisions nearly impossible to trace. For this
reason, interviews were often the only way to reconstruct some
events. Wherever possible, data and controversial issues discussed in
interviews were double checked against extant documentation, and/or
in subsequent interviews with other people. Von Braun, however, kept
a “Daily Journal,” that listed hourly appointments, travel
itineraries, and phone calls. Sometimes the Daily Journal included
summaries of conversations, and sometimes it included verbatim
transcriptions. In several instances, this made the “Daily Journal”
an invaluable aid in understanding an event. The “Daily Journal”
frequently included copies of memos and other instructions.

<p>The SHP files and other documentary files used
during preparation of the manuscript are listed below. (Although the
manuscript includes material available in the files of the History
Office, NASA Headquarters, it is not listed here because copies were

<h3>Other Sources</h3>
<p>The manuscript’s bibliography is represented
in its backnotes. These notes frequently include annotations on the
direct citation, in addition to a brief discussion of other relevant
sources. Because of the extent and nature of modern governmental
documentation, this short bibliographical essay describes classes of
documents in place of an extensive and formal listing of sources. It
is a summary of selected sources already discussed within the
backnotes themselves. The titles that follow are those that the
author most frequently consulted as a starting point, or for
guidelines, enlightenment, and specifics, particularly as they
pertained to NASA and the Saturn programs.</p>
<h3>Reference and Background</h3>
<p>A good bibliographic reference is Katherine
Murphy Dickson, <i>History of Aeronautics
and Astronautics: A Preliminary Bibliography</i> (Washington: NASA, 1968). Dickson’s work is
particularly valuable because of the succinct annotations.
<i>Astronautics and Aeronautics:
Chronology on Science, Technology, and Policy</i> (Washington, 1963–) is issued annually and contains
reference sources for each entry. For a well-illustrated historical
survey of rocketry, see Wernher von Braun and Frederick I. Ordway
III, <i>History of Rocketry and Space Travel</i> (New York, 1969). With von
Braun as co-author, the book carries special authority in its
discussion of many phases of the von Braun team, ABMA, and the Saturn
program. Eugene M. Emme, ed., <i>The
History of Rocket Technology: Essays on Research, Development, and
Utility</i> (Detroit, 1964), features
essays by historians, as well as participants, including von Braun.
Two other edited works, with contributions by key engineers and
managers themselves, are of special value. Ernst Stuhlinger,
Frederick I. Ordway III, Jerry C. McCall, and George C. Brown, eds.,
<i>Astronautical Engineering and Science:
From Peenemuende to Planetary Space</i>
(New York, 1963), includes a variety of semitechnical discussions,
prepared by engineers, that provide a good feel for the state of
astronautics in the early 1960s. The book was a <i>festschrift</i> honoring
Wernher von Braun on his 50th birthday, and its contributors had been
his associates at Peenemuende, Fort Bliss, and Huntsville. Most of
the essays have a historical theme. Edgar M. Cortright, ed.,
<i><a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html">Apollo
Expeditions to the Moon</a>
</i>(Washington, 1975), is a superbly
illustrated retrospective summary of the Apollo-Saturn program,
written by NASA astronauts and executives. Von Braun authored the
essay on the Saturn.</p>
<p>Several of NASA’s historical monographs were
especially useful in dealing with early space programs and with early
NASA activities. These include Constance Green and Milton Lomask,
<i>Vanguard: A History</i>, NASA SP-4202 (Washington, 1971); Robert L.
Rosholt, <i>An Administrative History of
NASA, 1958–1963</i>, NASA SP-4101
(Washington, 1966); and Loyd S. Swenson, James M. Grimwood, and
Charles C. Alexander, <i><a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/toc.htm">This
New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury</a></i>, NASA SP-4201 (Washington, 1966). For numerous charts,
tables, and graphs, on manpower, funding, and organization, see Jane
Van Nimmen, Leonard C. Bruno, and Robert L. Rosholt, <i><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4012/cover.html">NASA
Historical Data Book, 1958–1968</a></i>,
vol. I, NASA Resources, NASA SP-4012 (Washington, 1976). Bruce
Mazlish, ed., <i>The Railroad and the
Space Program: An Exploration in Historical Analogy</i> (Cambridge, Mass., 1965), offered a helpful framework
for historical perspectives.</p>
<p>The titles noted above were useful for Part
One and throughout the Saturn history. For specific sections of the
book, the following titles were especially valuable.</p>
<h3>Part Two</h3>
<p>Through its history office, MSFC sponsored its
own series of historical reviews. Volume I was published as
<i>Historical Origins of the George C.
Marshall Space Flight Center</i> (1960),
designated as MHM-1. Subsequent titles, numbered sequentially, were
called <i>History of the George C.
Marshall Space Flight Center</i>
and issued semiannually through MHM-11 (1965). Companion volumes
(designated as “Volume II” for each title) reproduced key documents
cited in these histories. Beginning in 1966, the semiannual histories
became annual <i>Chronologies</i>, designated
MHR-6 and subsequent, ending in 1969. Based largely on these
publications, MSFC issued a convenient chronology, David S. Akens,
<i>Saturn Illustrated Chronology: Saturn’s
First Eleven Years, April 1957 Through April 1968</i> (MSFC, 1971), which furnished appropriate dates and
titles of relevant documents for further research.</p>
<h3>Part Three and Part Four</h3>
<p>These sections deal with the principal
components of Saturn hardware. Heinz H. Koelle, ed., <i>Handbook of Astronautical Engineering</i> (New York, 1961), provides an excellent survey of
astronautical state of the art as of the early 1960s. This
encyclopedic book treats structures, propulsion, guidance, and other
significant topics. See also, Frederick I. Ordway III, James Patrick
Gardner, and Mitchell R. Sharpe, <i>Basic
Astronautics</i> (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.,
1962), an introductory text by authors especially oriented to NASA’s
launch vehicle program.</p>
<p>Two invaluable references for understanding
the Saturn launch vehicles themselves are NASA-MSFC, <i>Saturn IB News Reference</i>
(1968), and NASA-MSFC, <i>Saturn V News
Reference</i> (1968). Produced by MSFC in
cooperation with the major Saturn contractors, each three-ring
loose-leaf volume illustrates essential Saturn systems, subsystems,
components, and miscellaneous hardware. The accompanying text
describes, in semitechnical terms, the function and operation of a
bewildering array of Saturn hardware. As a means of grasping the
complexities of the Saturn launch vehicle and the essentials of the
different stages, including tankage, engines, and guidance, they are
indispensable.</p>
<p>On engines, in particular, see Dieter K. Huzel
and David H. Huang, <i>Design of Liquid
Propellant Rocket Engines</i>, NASA SP-125
(Washington, 1971). Both men were Rocketdyne engineers; although the
book’s numerous fine illustrations do not specifically identify
engine components, the illustrations and descriptions obviously owe
much to Rocketdyne’s development and production of the H-1, F-1, and
J-2, making this publication uniquely interesting for the Saturn
history. William J. Brennan, a top Rocketdyne executive, presented to
an AIAA meeting a succinct but comprehensive historical overview of
rocket engines, “Milestones in Cryogenic Liquid Propellant Rocket
Engines,” published as AIAA Paper 67-978 (Oct. 1967). For the Saturn
generally, see Leland F. Belew, W. H. Patterson, and J. W. Thomas,
Jr., “Apollo Vehicle Propulsion Systems,” AIAA Paper 65-303 (July
1965).</p>
<p>The procedures used in the fabrication of
stages borrowed from prior aircraft experience and from extant
techniques used in military rocket boosters. A useful semitechnical
overview of contemporaneous practice is Frank W. Wilson and Walter R.
Prange, eds., <i>Tooling for Aircraft and
Missile Manufacture</i> (New York, 1964).
Nevertheless, production of the various stages of Saturn presented
new problems in metallurgy, tooling, and welding. The evolution of
the S-IVB upper stage presented many typical problems. See, for
example, K. H. Boucher, “Saturn Third Stage S-IVB Manufacturing,”
Douglas Paper 3707 (1965), and E. Harpoothian, “The Production of
Large Tanks for Cryogenic Fuels,” Douglas Paper 3155 (1964). For
discussion of the S-IC, see George Alexander, “Boeing Faces Unique
Fabrication Challenge.” <i>Aviation Week
and Space Technology</i>, 77 (13 Aug.
1962): 52–63; Whitney G. Smith, “Fabricating the Saturn S-IC
Booster,” AIAA Paper 65-294 (1965). The S-II stage was plagued by
welding problems, as described in an anonymous article, “The Toughest
Weld of All,” <i>Skyline</i> (1968), an unpaged reprint in the SHP files. Despite
an obvious bias, company magazines like North American’s
<i>Skyline</i>
and Boeing’s <i>Boeing Magazine</i> frequently carried valuable descriptive
articles and illustrations. The authoritative articles in
<i>Aviation Week and Space
Technology</i> are also valuable for their
depth and accuracy.</p>
<p>On computers and guidance, see D. Morris
Schmidt, “Survey of Automatic Checkout Systems for Saturn V Stages,”
MSFC, 10 July 1968. C. Stark Draper, Walter Wrigley, and John
Hovorka, <i>Inertial
Guidance</i> (New York, 1960), is a basic
treatise. A study closely related to the Saturn program and its
immediate predecessors is F. K. Mueller, “A History of Inertial
Guidance,” ABMA, Redstone Arsenal, Ala. (1959), written by one of the
originators of the guidance systems for the V-2.</p>
<h3>Part Five</h3>
<p>For a comprehensive analysis of management
theories and organization at the height of the Apollo-Saturn program,
see Apollo Program Office, NASA Headquarters, <i>NASA-Apollo Program Management</i> (1967), a project that covered NASA centers as well as
major contractors, and ran to 14 volumes. For all this elaborate
managerial superstructure, the flavor of operational problems and
frustrations stands out in annual reviews like NASA Headquarters,
Office of Programs and Special Reports, <i>Program Review: Apollo</i>
(1962–1966). The complexities of logistics near the peak of
Apollo-Saturn can be examined in <i>First
Annual Logistics Management Symposium, 13–14 September 1966</i>,
NASA TMX-53566 (16 Jan. 1967). See also
John C. Goodrum and S. M. Smolensky, “The Saturn Vehicle Logistics
Support System,” AIAA Paper No. 65-268 (April 1965).</p>
<h3>Part Six</h3>
<p>The best single summary reference for all
Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V launches is the tabulation by
William A. Lockyer, Jr., ed., <i>A Summary
of Major NASA Launchings, Eastern Test Range and Western Test Range:
October 1, 1958 to September 30, 1970</i>,
Kennedy Space Center, Fla., Historical Report No. 1 (Revised, 1970).
A readable and instructive account of launch activities at Cape
Kennedy and the launch of a Saturn V is Gene Bylinsky, “Dr. von
Braun’s All-Purpose Space Machine,” <i>Fortune</i>, 75 (May 1967): 142–49.
For dimensions, weights, duration, and other specifics of Saturn V
launches, see MSFC, <i>Saturn V Flight
Manual</i>, SA-501, through SA-509, which
was the last flight manual issued. Astronaut Michael Collins has
written a marvelous, colorful memoir, <i>Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut’s
Journeys</i> (New York, 1974), that
includes his account of what it was like to ride a Saturn V into
space.</p>
<h3>Part Seven</h3>
<p>Raymond A. Bauer, <i>Second-Order Consequences: A Methodological Essay on
the Impact of Technology</i> (Cambridge,
1969), is an insightful and provocative book generally concerned with
the implications of space exploration. The local impact on Huntsville
is graphically conveyed in the special supplement of the Huntsville
<i>Times</i>,
“25 Years Since” (3 Nov. 1974), in remembrance of the evolution of
rocketry since the von Braun group’s arrival at Redstone Arsenal in
1949.</p>
