<p>
This EPUB version of <i>Stages to Saturn</i> is based on the
<a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/sp4206.htm">HTML version</a>
published by the NASA History Office.
Many small changes and improvements have been made:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of typos have been found and fixed by comparing the text
to an independent
<a href="http://archive.org/details/stagestosaturnte00bilsrich">scan
of the book</a> from the Internet Archive.</li>
<li>Many illustrations have been improved using high-resolution
versions published by NASA and other sources.</li>
<li>Illustrations have been reorganized to better fit the EPUB
medium.</li>
<li>The use of italic text, en dash (–) and em dash (—) has been
restored to match the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A complete list of changes and the tools used can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/foolip/stagestosaturn">Git repository</a>.
